    "text": " But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so does that mean I need to consider how \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the coefficient? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if in \\((a + b)^4\\) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can cancel each other out) is something, then the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times that something. But wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part of the product and \\(c\\) is in the other, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, what's the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but not necessarily requiring it to be a specific power. Wait, that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually with respect to specific terms. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that the product becomes a term without \\(c\\), thus contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\). Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would include terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2, because each term in the expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) where \\(k\\) is the number of times \\(1/c\\) is chosen. Wait, no, actually, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents go from \\(6\\) (when \\(k=0\\)) down to \\(-6\\) (when \\(k=6\\)), in steps of 2. So, the term where \\(c^{0}\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term \\(c^0\\) has coefficient 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has coefficient 20. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I had considered other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), they would contribute to other powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something would be the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate.

Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so multiplying them gives 384. That seems correct.

But since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) will just tag along without affecting the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm making a mistake here. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 from the first part, and since we're multiplying by the entire expansion of the second part, which has 64 as the sum of coefficients, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and when multiplied by the entire expression in \\(c\\), it's 6 times that expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), meaning when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, and then we need to find that constant. Hmm, that might be a different interpretation. Let me think again. The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part (the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion) multiplied by 6. Because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by each term in the second part, each of those terms will have coefficients, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)), then we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) first. Let me check the problem statement again: It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so now I'm confused because I have two different interpretations leading to two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then that would include all powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 384. However, sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, which is it? Let me think. The problem is written as: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in algebraic expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's the sum of all coefficients from all terms that have exactly that combination of variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible combinations with other variables. But in this case, the expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. Wait, no, that's not the right example. Wait, in this case, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would have terms \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(1/c\\) is 1, same for \\(b\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it would be the sum of coefficients from the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Alternatively, let me think of another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120 if considering the constant term. But no, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\) = \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4. But if I look at the expanded form, the terms involving \\(ab\\) are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), so the coefficients are 2c and 2/c, which are not constants. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of the coefficients, which is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So, that matches with 2 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)) = 4. So, that seems correct. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be treated as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms would only affect the overall coefficient as a multiplier. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify: The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would result in terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be any term in that expansion, because when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) in the term must be zero. Because if the exponent is zero, then \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term. So, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), which is 1. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20 \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. So, when you multiply them, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. Then, for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), yes, that's 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems right. I think that's the correct coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the terms from each expansion that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term independent of \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   - The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) it's 20.\n   - Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms where each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps I misread it. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when you consider the entire product, but only for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(c\\) is another variable, the terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. Let me assume that's the case. So, the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I made an incorrect assumption. Let me double-check. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical value, so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me think again: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated because the two parts are multiplied together. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, so maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that the product is a sum of terms, each involving \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) and \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're only looking at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve both parts. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That sounds more plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by including \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient, so maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so their product is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Let me think differently: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term 6a^2b^2 in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me verify: Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply out the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the sense of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the central term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120. But the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Hmm, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is any power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the answer would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied, the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*20=120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6*20=120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6*20=120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. But I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me check: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6*20=120. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the correct answer is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it differently. Let me think: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is 2^6=64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm not entirely sure because the problem could be interpreted in different ways. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Let me see if the problem specifies anything about \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This expansion will contribute a factor to each term in the product.

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the multiplication would involve terms from both expansions. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part, because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), etc. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that might not be the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by terms with \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will have some power of \\(c\\). So, the entire expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean treating the second part as a constant, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes problems ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it would be 6 * sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. Hmm, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. But let me check again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. However, I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in such problems, they might be considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which would be 120. But I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Wait, but let me think differently. Suppose I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That would mean, in the expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second part. The coefficient of each such term would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that is multiplied by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But just to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a bad example. Let me take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), it would be 2. Hmm, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), that's 2. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   Setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{384}"

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which could be constants or other terms, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also seems off. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that's multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c^k\\) term, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'm confused. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have a coefficient, say, \\(k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(k \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different. So, let me try that approach as well. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in this case, we need to consider the product of the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) such that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, let's break it down. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the confusion is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's the former, meaning the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check the problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, meaning that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply expecting the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely that it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also at its term, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Let me confirm this by another approach. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 384, because it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials with different variables, it's usually looking for the coefficient when all variables are considered, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. But given that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 384. However, I'm now unsure because in standard problems, when you have separate variables, the coefficients are considered separately. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. To resolve this, let me check an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if someone asks for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. But if they ask for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), that would be 1. So, in this case, the problem is similar. If they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 384 when considering all coefficients. But if they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit confused because usually, when variables are separate, the coefficients are considered separately. So, perhaps the correct answer is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the other polynomial, which would be 120. I think I need to decide which"

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. Since the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the other part is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider the coefficients from the second part as well? Wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will only come from the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c^k\\) term, unless \\(k = 0\\), it won't be a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, correct. So, when you multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only combine with the constant term from the second part to give a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is 120. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if we take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that would appear only if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (if any) in the second part. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, which would come from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.

Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when we multiply by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient just the product of the two coefficients? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part would contribute other terms. But wait, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the overall term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever \\(c^0\\) term is in the second part. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from other terms as well? Or is it only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second expression? Hmm, I think it's the latter. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require that the term from the second expansion is \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me think again: is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could there be a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by another term from \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Hmm, no, because any term from the second expansion would have some power of \\(c\\), unless it's the \\(c^0\\) term. So, only the \\(c^0\\) term would, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\).

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct either because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate because the terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion, leading to a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), while terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would create terms with \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2/c\\), etc., which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, perhaps the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), that should give me the answer. Let me check if that makes sense. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because that's the term that won't affect the exponent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I had to consider the entire expansion, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that contributes is the constant term, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which likely means the coefficient when considering all terms, so perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, going back, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect that term? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the other part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a scalar multiple. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that can't be right. Wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum over all possible terms, which isn't correct. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 1, and there are \\(2^6\\) terms. Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) aren't all 1. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, let me approach it that way. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, getting the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where \\(c^0\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The exponent of \\(c\\) in each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) is the term index. So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has coefficient 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but actually, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, perhaps the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which would include the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). Each of these is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire coefficient, including the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. Let me check that interpretation. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would mean the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That would make sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me proceed with that assumption. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's \\(c^0\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would have been 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation was to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient is usually a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 120, considering the constant term. Let me check online if similar problems exist. Wait, I can't actually look things up, but based on standard problems, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, they usually consider the entire expression, so if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would include the other variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is involved, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, maybe I should interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual for a coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Given that, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). The coefficient is 20.\n\n3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those in \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it 6 times each individual coefficient? Wait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, and then all those are added together to form the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, then 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficients in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is just multiplied along. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're asked for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 384. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be the same. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial, not a number. But in our original problem, we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's a numerical coefficient, but in reality, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because usually, when you talk about the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you consider the coefficient as a number, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be considered as a numerical coefficient when combining all terms, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of the coefficients, i.e., the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\). Because if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the other expansion, it will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by a constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. If there were non-constant terms, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure out what that is. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check my reasoning. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I correctly identified that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, leading to \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the steps.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a number, not an expression with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the other expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these together, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), the answer would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume they want the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I was right the first time; the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense either because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the correct interpretation. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product is a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product would look like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), and then for each such term, multiply by the corresponding term from the other expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that doesn't make sense because the exponent of \\(c\\) would vary. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I thought earlier.

Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, corresponding to \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving a coefficient of 20.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all the terms in the other part. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that's the only term that will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is still \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to clarify, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the constant term really 20? Let me check the expansion again. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, so it wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) will just contribute a constant factor to the coefficient we're seeking. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just multiply that coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we just need to multiply the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not a product. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so perhaps it's the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems correct, but let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see what the coefficients are, then multiply by 6. Let me try that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product simply the product of the coefficients from each part? Because in the expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c\\) term would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the term where \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) equals \\(c^k\\), but in this case, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), does that mean we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a number, not a term with \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in multiple variables, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check again: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all the terms are multiplied together, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me check: \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only for the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, let me try that approach. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and we need to multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is what the problem is asking for. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\), but the problem statement is unclear. Wait, maybe I should reread the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps I'm making an incorrect assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignore the other part. But that seems unlikely because the other part is given in the product. Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be represented as a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think the most reasonable assumption is that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me confirm: If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the answer is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is found when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, that's not correct either because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can consider the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Therefore, I need to find two things: 1) The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2) The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because sometimes when I'm dealing with multiple variables, I might get confused. So, just to make sure, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term in the second expression will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're adding exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's possible that in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute their coefficients to the overall expression. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. Since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just the coefficient when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, which would be 6, and the rest is separate. Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions, so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, perhaps the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check another way. Let's expand both expressions separately and then see. The first expansion: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a coefficient, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just need the constant term to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, if I'm not mistaken, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you expand it, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, actually, each term in the product will have some power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product for every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the question is about a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit unusual, as coefficients are typically numerical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) in the other expansion. That would make the coefficient a number. So, maybe the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems reasonable. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (20)\\), because only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, if we're considering the entire product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense, and the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   Thus, the constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is entirely from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part's expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term in the first expansion, when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be the case, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you have to consider all terms. Wait, no, actually, when you expand the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is added together when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. That makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). 3. Multiply the two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right either. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is something like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be \\(6\\) times the entire second expansion. But when considering the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the second expansion isn't just being summed; it's being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But actually, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of any term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Wait, that makes more sense. Because if it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. How do I find that? Using the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, that's different from the 384 I thought earlier. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me verify that. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives \\(20c^0\\), so when multiplied together, it's \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so the coefficient is 120. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times all powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this part? Let me think. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the variables multiply in a way that gives the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be the case. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but since the second part has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient in the second part is... wait, no, the second part is multiplied by each term, but since we're just taking the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is intended to have the terms multiplied together, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second part, each term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the way terms combine can be different, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), it should just be the product of the coefficients. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expansion, but that would be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) is the middle term. Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so I need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the central term when expanding, which is when the exponent is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because you choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). But wait, that contradicts the other approach where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is correct? Let me think again. The key here is whether \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that includes any \\(c\\) terms or not. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, my initial approach was wrong because I thought it was multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, but actually, it's only multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the correct coefficient is 120. That makes more sense. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake in considering whether the terms combine differently. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is indeed the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by this 20, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I must have confused myself earlier by thinking about the sum of all coefficients, but actually, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But since we are just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term's coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second polynomial would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it another way. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how the coefficients multiply. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to the product, right? So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{something}\\right)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\text{sum of coefficients in something}\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is a polynomial, when you multiply, each term in the second polynomial gets multiplied by 6, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), as I had before. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again: when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 384 is the right coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, this expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."
