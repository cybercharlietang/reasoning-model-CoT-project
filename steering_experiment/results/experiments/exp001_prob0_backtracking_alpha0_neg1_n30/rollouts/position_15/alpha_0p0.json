    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe I can just focus on the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), which are separate, maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, it would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) involved, but we're only interested in the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and there's no \\(c\\) involved. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I needed the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. Multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must multiply in such a way that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems like it would give me a polynomial where each term is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get a term that's just a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow 2k = 6 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term of 20. When I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and see how the terms combine. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and since there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms in the other factor, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the other part contributes a constant term, which is 20, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, so does the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the coefficient itself is a term involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but perhaps the user wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems unlikely because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they might be looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). That seems plausible. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (in \\(c\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems less likely. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more reasonable to assume that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the answer would be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, is that right?

Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just getting \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\).

Or is it just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently. Maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate binomial expansion and find its sum of coefficients, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (from the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) really 6 times 64? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you're combining all terms. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) might be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term. Wait, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the other part. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not right because when you multiply, the coefficients add, but in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Wait, no, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion of the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would require me to find the term where, in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the answer is 384, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the term where the exponents of all variables are specified, but in this case, the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific exponent for \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because when you multiply, you have to consider the entire expansion. I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining them. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\n3. **Combine the two expansions:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't have to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then the other terms involving \\(c\\) would have to multiply by terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute to the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the other expression is in terms of \\(c\\), when you multiply them, the \\(c\\) terms will just be part of the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from the second expression}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would imply that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that seems too large. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from each term in the second expansion, which is the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expression isn't a single term, it's a sum of terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems correct because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and all those contributions add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expression, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the second expression, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms in the second expression multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second expression is being multiplied, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expression contributes its own coefficient. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that can't be because the second expression isn't a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, that seems high. Let me check another way.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would affect the coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something else, it would change the term. Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it would create a new term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, perhaps I need to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, and thus not be a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that makes sense. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Because if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^k\\), then the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, that would give me the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems confusing because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by those terms. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the overall coefficient. But actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the product will have terms that are the product of each term from the first expression and each term from the second expression. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\) where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers from 0 to 4 and 0 to 6 respectively. Simplifying that, it's \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier, and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for the second part, we need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficients from the second part are specific to each term, not a single sum. Actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a separate term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, the second part's coefficients would just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of their coefficients. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, first, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that's not the case because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me consider that maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think my initial approach is correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be different. Let me check that. If the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I would need to find the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would mean \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), so I think the first approach is correct, giving 384. Hmm, but maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the structure of the product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the sum of all those products, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), giving 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c \\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) doesn't exist here because it's \\((a + b)^1\\), but if it were \\((a + b)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But actually, when you expand \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just calculate it directly. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients, and each of those coefficients will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part's expansion, because each term in the second part multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first part, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a"

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20 from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied by 1, or maybe their coefficients will also contribute. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the first part, so when we multiply by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we just want the coefficient for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps we're only considering the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the rest is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the terms. So, that would mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power. Let me check that. So, in that case, I would first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which equals 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's just 6, because when you multiply by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all the terms in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a single number; it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, leading to a coefficient of 120. Let me double-check my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion.

But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But wait, that's not right either because each term in the second expansion is a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but considering the \\(c\\) terms as well. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients for terms involving different variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple.

But the sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's 2^6 = 64, as I thought before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\). But that seems unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together, but that would require considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is not what the problem is asking.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but I don't know. Let me try to see if I can interpret the problem correctly. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we need the coefficient for all such terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so each term would have a coefficient multiplied by 6. But that's not a single number. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion, meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. Let me check that. So, if I interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I can proceed as follows: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. 2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient. That seems plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the only way the problem makes sense is if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case the answer is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would require summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which isn't feasible because the problem expects a numerical answer. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's implied that we're looking for the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also consider the constant term (in \\(c\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the part that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by whatever comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that \\(c\\) terms can be anything. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Hmm, I'm confused now. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single coefficient but rather a coefficient that's a polynomial. That can't be right. Maybe I need to interpret the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, treating all variables as separate. So, in other words, when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only happen if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Because then, \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant term would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Then, multiply those two results together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Okay, so let's do that. First, as I found, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, I correctly identified that to get a term without \\(c\\) in the product, the second expansion must have a constant term, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these results together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not in \\(c\\), that would mean that we only take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, first, let me confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, how do I find that? Let me think. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also a binomial expansion. So, using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's just a scalar multiple. Wait, no, that can't be right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me double-check this because I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. Therefore, when you expand the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think of it as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have separate variables, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their exponents don't interact with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Wait, actually, does it? Let me check: The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering all possible terms, but actually, since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the other polynomial. So, that would make the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, so which is it? 120 or 384? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), but when you're looking for a specific term in the product that doesn't involve c, you need to find the term where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., the constant term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the constant term in Q(c). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, let me check by expanding a small part. Let me consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, if I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, up to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) being 6 * 1 = 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, that would be when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20 in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was a mistake because I was considering all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any c's. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, as calculated using the binomial theorem. Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a factor that's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, you get a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and something from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a part of the product, I think I might be misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), thus contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the other variables. So, perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\) for the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be present in the expansion as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their exponents are fixed, and the second part doesn't affect them. So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum of terms from the second part. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I can treat the two parts separately. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and that coefficient times the \\(c\\) term. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that doesn't make sense because the product includes the second part. Hmm, maybe I should check by expanding both parts separately and then multiplying. Let me try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for exponents 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 respectively. Now, when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Wait, that's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But let me double-check that logic. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6 times each coefficient, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's effectively 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, if we're considering all possible terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes from the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but in reality, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider any terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times something. Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's considering all terms where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the second part is a separate expansion, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Okay, that seems plausible. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, multiply them together to get the final coefficient. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by all terms from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial approach was correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient when you multiply the two expressions. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me check that. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to parse it again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the product and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so when multiplied by 64, it becomes 6 * 64 = 384. So, is the coefficient 384? But wait, that seems like a possible approach, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me think differently. Maybe I can consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but that would require knowing the specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^1\\) is 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) would be 1*1=1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1*(sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\)) which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. But that's not correct because the actual coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 2. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)) which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 multiplied by each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms, so the \\(c\\) expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*64=384. That seems to make sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate factors. So, the expansion would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, unless the second part has a term that is 1, which would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) to stand alone, but in reality, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if \\(c^0 = 1\\), then that term would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part.

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). When you multiply these together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That would mean that we're considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what the \\(c\\) terms are. So, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually depend on the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because when you reverse the terms, the exponents change sign. Alternatively, using the binomial theorem, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so now I have two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the expression also includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, but when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion adds a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts the other approach where I considered only the constant term in the second expansion. So, which is correct? Let me think about what the problem is asking. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. That would mean that we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless there's a \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then that term is just \\(a^2b^2\\), so its coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. But if you consider all the other terms, like \\(a^2b^2c\\), those are different terms, so their coefficients don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, the answer should be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion. I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if we take any other term from the second polynomial, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^2\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct answer is 120. I think my initial confusion was whether to consider all terms or only the constant term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), we only need to consider the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by 1 (since we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so maybe the coefficient remains 6. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions, and when you multiply them, you can get terms that combine the exponents. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the term where \\(c^0\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be affected by the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, when you expand, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be treated separately. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the product of the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that might not be the case because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable.

But that can't be, because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, since the two expressions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a red herring. But that seems unlikely because the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would be 6 times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, since the exponents go from 6 to -6 in steps of -2. Wait, actually, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need to find the term where the exponent is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, which interpretation is correct? Hmm. The problem is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. Let me see which makes more sense. In typical problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's usually considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. Since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 384. But to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. First, if we consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second expression is multiplied by it, the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the entire second expression. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20, so 6*20=120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But just to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second). So, that aligns with the idea that the coefficient is 6*64=384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem asks for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the entire expansion would be a product of two separate binomial expansions. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe I can just consider the coefficients separately and then multiply them? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the answer would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient is a constant. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think about that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^m\\) where \\(m\\) is some exponent. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), I would have to sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems like an infinite series, which isn't practical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient is a constant. That might make sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply 6 by that constant term, I get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, and just multiplied the entire expansion, but that would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. But the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, maybe I need to consider all possible terms in the second expression that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expression would just add a factor, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that seems a bit off because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think again. If I have two separate expressions multiplied together, one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\), then when I expand the product, each term in the product will be a term from the first expression multiplied by a term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficients add up. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in the second expression would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the entire expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient would be 384. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will just add a factor involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to summing over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't consider that, maybe I could have thought that the coefficient is just 6, but that would be incorrect because the second part contributes a factor that scales the coefficient. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me check another way. Let me expand both parts separately and see. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): as we saw, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion of the second part is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the sum is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with my earlier conclusion. Therefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the entire expansion of the second part is just a scalar multiple, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which would affect the overall expression, but not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would then be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part's expansion includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me work on that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times 20? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for each term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is being multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have extra factors of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\) will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the second part's expansion contributes a factor of 20 when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient becomes 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
