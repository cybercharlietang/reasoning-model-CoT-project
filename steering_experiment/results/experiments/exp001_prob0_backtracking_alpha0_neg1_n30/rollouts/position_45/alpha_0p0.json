When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, as I found earlier, that term is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we're essentially looking for the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiplying it by 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. Alternatively, if I wanted to see this another way, I could consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the variable part, we can treat the second part as a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're looking for the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(k = 0\\). So, only the term where \\(k = 0\\) in the second expansion would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me try another approach to confirm. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). From \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, the coefficient is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, it's a sum of terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as before. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid. Let me just check if I can think of another way to approach this, maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. Hmm, but in this case, since the variables are separate, it's just the product of the coefficients from each binomial expansion.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that there are other terms that, when multiplied, could result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, could a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) somehow combine to give a constant term, but also affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? But no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term only comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, I think 120 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion, but that might be more complicated. Let me see: If I were to expand both parts fully, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).
