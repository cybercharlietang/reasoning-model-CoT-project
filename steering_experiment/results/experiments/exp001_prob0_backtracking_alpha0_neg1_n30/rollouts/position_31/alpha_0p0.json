Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\).

So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is obtained by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial.

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), found the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, multiplied them together to get 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. The binomial coefficients are correct: 4 choose 2 is 6, and 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that again gives us 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that still holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then I'm only interested in the terms where the product doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is when we take the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that approach also leads to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the relevant terms from each part of the product. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"
