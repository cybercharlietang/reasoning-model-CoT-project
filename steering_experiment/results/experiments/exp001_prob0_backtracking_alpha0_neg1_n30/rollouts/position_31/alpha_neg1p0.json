Let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I correctly identified that in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.

I set up the equation \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and found \\(m = 3\\), leading to the coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. I think that's correct. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so when looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), you only consider the parts that cancel out the \\(c\\) terms, which happens when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance each other out, leading to \\(c^0\\).

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. For the binomial coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120, which seems correct. Also, I considered that only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yes, I think that's right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.
