Because 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. Yes, that's correct. And 6 choose 3 is 20, because 6! / (3!3!) = 720 / (6*6) = 720 / 36 = 20. So that's correct too. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.

Wait, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. But when I was calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), I thought it was 20, but let me check again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20 because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So that's correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(k=2\\), as we did before, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part comes from \\(m=3\\). So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 a^2b^2\\) times \\(20 c^0\\), which is \\(120 a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.
