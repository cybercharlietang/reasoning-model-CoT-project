For the \\(c\\) terms, we need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yep, that checks out.

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Multiplying them together gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second polynomial.
