Similarly, any other combination would involve \\(c\\) terms, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Wait, but just to make sure, let me try expanding both parts a bit more. For \\((a + b)^4\\), expanding it fully: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expanding it fully: the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The middle term is when the exponent is 0, which is when \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply the 20 from the second, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), and that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes 20 as the constant term, so 6a^2b^2 times 20 gives 120a^2b^2. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, since any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would affect the variables. So, yes, that approach seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply, you're effectively taking each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) and multiplying it by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is to take the constant term from \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.
