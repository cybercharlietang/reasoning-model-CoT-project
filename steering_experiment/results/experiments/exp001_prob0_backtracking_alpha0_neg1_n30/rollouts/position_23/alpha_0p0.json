Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term, which is 20, so indeed 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you only consider the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part.

That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient becomes the product of the two coefficients. So, first, I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here.

Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me confirm that reasoning. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. Any other term from the second part would have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, yes, I only need the constant term from the second expansion. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and realized that to get a term without \\(c\\), I needed the constant term. I used the binomial theorem, found the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and calculated that coefficient as 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   The constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. So, let me now find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"
