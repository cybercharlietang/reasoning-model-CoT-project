So, first, I already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Let me verify that. So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\) because of the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(m - n\\), since \\(c^m \\times c^{-n} = c^{m - n}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because we're looking for the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). So, we need \\(m - n = 0\\), which implies \\(m = n\\). Since \\(m + n = 6\\), substituting \\(n = m\\) gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term we're interested in is when \\(m = 3\\) and \\(n = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) times \\(c^3\\) times \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} \\times c^{3 - 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is 20.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion, which is 20. Since when you multiply these together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only be affected by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just think if there's any other way this could be approached. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if there's another term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but I don't think so because the \\(c\\) terms are separate.
