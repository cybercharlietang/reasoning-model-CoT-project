I just realized that in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but when you expand it, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. But let me make sure that I didn't miss anything else. For example, is there a possibility that another term from the first expansion could, when multiplied by a term from the second, give \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so, because all other terms in the first expansion have different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which has powers of \\(c\\), they would result in terms that include \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, no, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when I was thinking about it, I considered that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc., and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). All other terms will have a power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think my initial conclusion was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. Suppose I write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term like \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 4, and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) = \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6. So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). So, that gives \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think I've considered all angles here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " \n\nWait, hold on a second. I just realized something. The original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, the terms are products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion. But is there any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear? For example, if I have a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and then multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-k}\\), would that give me \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, but in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, I might have made a mistake earlier. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and every term in the second polynomial. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'd end up with a term that has \\(c\\) in it, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was right the first time. But just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. Let me denote the first expansion as \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and the second expansion as \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). When I multiply these two, each term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms in the final product (since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)). So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I thought earlier. So, I'm confident now that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: suppose I don't separate the two expansions. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\), because any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, again, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways, and 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI guess I was overcomplicating it for a moment, but now I'm sure. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
