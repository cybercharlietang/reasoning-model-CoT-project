Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but considering the expansion, maybe it's correct. Let me think about it another way. If I were to expand both expressions fully, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)), which is 20, then yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). Let's compute that and see if the method works. Expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero in this case because the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(ab\\) and \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not helpful because in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't even exist. Maybe a different example. Let's take \\((a + b)^3 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^3\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 * 3 = 9. Let me check by expanding. \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^3 = c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). When I multiply these, the term \\(a^2b\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, in the problem, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this example, I'm looking for \\(a^2b\\). Hmm, maybe this isn't the best example. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but in this problem, we're only interested in the terms where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms in the final product. So, in the original problem, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But just to be thorough, let me think again. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will only contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).
