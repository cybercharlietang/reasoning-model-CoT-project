So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because if I take any other term from the second part, it would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
