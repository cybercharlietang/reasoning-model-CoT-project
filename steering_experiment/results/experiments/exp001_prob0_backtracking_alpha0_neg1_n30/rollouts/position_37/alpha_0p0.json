So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second part. So, when expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Hmm, I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out.

Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we only want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\), which is just one term, the constant term. So, that term's coefficient is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, could there be any other terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term without \\(c\\)? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple when multiplied by other terms. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20.

So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each individual expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. That makes sense because any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would change the term we're looking for. So, I think I did that correctly. Let me just double-check the calculations. The binomial coefficient for 4 choose 2 is indeed 6, and for 6 choose 3, it's 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, so that seems right.
