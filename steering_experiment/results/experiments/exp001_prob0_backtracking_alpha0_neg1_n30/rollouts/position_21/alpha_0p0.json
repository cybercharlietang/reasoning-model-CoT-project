    "text": " But since we're looking for a specific term in the product, which is \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Wait, no, actually, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have \\(c\\)), then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would remain, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, let me try that approach. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of these two coefficients, because the \\(c\\) terms in the second expression don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when you multiply these, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product: each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we only care about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that isn't a constant would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that accurate? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let me calculate that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the presence of the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the second factor doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the second factor doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second factor, you're scaling the entire expression, so the coefficients should scale accordingly. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something here. Let me approach it differently. Let's denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product is \\(A \\times B\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\). Since \\(A\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(B\\) has terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms, so actually, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you're effectively scaling it by each coefficient in \\(B\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all those contributions. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(B\\)). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the presence of \\(B\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(B\\), it's like scaling the entire expression by \\(B\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(B\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all these contributions, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the coefficient is simply 6 because the second factor doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second factor, you're scaling the entire expression, so the coefficients should be scaled accordingly. Let me think differently. Suppose I write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the second factor doesn't affect it because it's being multiplied by all terms, but that doesn't make sense because the second factor has terms with coefficients, so they should scale the coefficients in the first factor. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Let me just verify once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would just be \\(6 \\times a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would effectively be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but I think the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum of multiple terms. So, I think that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would be a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire product, when you expand everything, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient for that term, considering all possible terms from the other part. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible combinations from the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the \\(c\\) terms are independent. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. Because in that case, we would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, when you expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from, say, -6 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that the second part is a separate polynomial, so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo and meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if I can find any other approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found earlier, with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a very large coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is just a separate term, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power and multiplied, so it should affect the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me double-check this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. As I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should look back at the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, the coefficients multiply, but the variables multiply as well. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should multiply. Wait, no, because the variables are different. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate polynomial, so the overall coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is 2. Similarly, in our problem, if we set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But that's only if we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify that. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient"

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied by 1 (or constants) when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term with \\(c\\)). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would mean the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is a constant term. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let's break this down. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is equal to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these together, you get 6*20=120. That seems correct. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think through it again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should treat the two parts separately. Since the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but is that correct? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're not considering \\(c\\) in our target term, maybe it's just that the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-6 + m})\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(Q\\) is a separate polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) multiplied by every possible term in \\(Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let me compute that. The sum of coefficients in \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(P\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is simply the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without considering \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's just 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both expressions and find the coefficient. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think differently. Suppose I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\), but instead, I realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is to the power 0. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's see: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent is 0. So, in the expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), so setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think of it as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can have any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the expanded form, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. Wait, but that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be the latter. Let me check. Let me consider the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't the case. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion,\" without specifying \\(c\\), it could be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems more complicated, and I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, perhaps I should go with 120 as the answer. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but I'm still a bit uncertain because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Maybe I should look for another way to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all coefficients of \\(c\\), which might not be the intended approach. Alternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. Hmm, I'm still not sure. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all these products. Therefore, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. But then, why does the problem mention \\(c\\) if it's not relevant? Maybe it's a trick question where the answer is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. Wait, no, because when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)."

Is that correct? Let me think. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only then, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we'll get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, contributing to the coefficient. So, I think that's the right approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems unnecessary because we only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't add any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is the one where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, which is correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I considered that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term in the second expansion. So, I found that the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product and see if the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed affected only by the constant term in the second expansion. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in the second expansion that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think I did this correctly.

    "text": " But in this case, we're looking for a specific term in the product. Wait, actually, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms contributes their own coefficient, and since we're summing over all possibilities, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should first compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. The total expression is the product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiplier. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so it's a separate variable. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) just get multiplied as coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms in \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but actually, no. Let me think about it as a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients. So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. And as I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of its coefficients is. Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of the coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before. So, that confirms that the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would actually be the sum of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the other expansion.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) would just be coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and we're to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem expects a numerical answer, I think. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) might be present, but we're only interested in the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's work on that. First, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20. Since these two expansions are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) dependence. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term is independent of \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought before, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But wait, no, because \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all its terms, but since we're multiplying, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just check if I made any mistakes. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1.

But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would mean I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part's entire expansion is just a scalar multiplier. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part could have terms that affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but no, because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same as in the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, simplifying the second part: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, k = 2, and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't matter; we just need to sum over all possible m. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over m from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with my previous result. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term (or the sum of all coefficients) in the second polynomial. Wait, but the second polynomial isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's just the product of the two coefficients. Wait, no, because the second part isn't a single term; it's a sum of terms. So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Which brings me back to 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion and check, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with exponents of c ranging from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2, because each term is c^{6 - 2m}. So, the sum of all coefficients would be when c = 1, which is 2^6 = 64, as before. So, yeah, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would change the term, but since we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part has to be \\(c^0\\) to not affect it. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, first, I have the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients multiply when looking for the specific term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), but actually, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a single expansion, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

And since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, as I thought before, then 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when I expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left(\\text{something with } c\\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part. Because each term in the other part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm by expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 384. Let me think again: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check if I'm supposed to consider that maybe \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other terms might have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as well, but no, in this case, the other part is only in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then that coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, it's just a scalar multiple. So, yeah, I think 384 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we consider the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients as \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem seems to ask for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would include terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. But that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then we multiply it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would include terms with various powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. Let me assume that for a moment. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)) is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm making an incorrect assumption. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all zero except for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems more likely. So, I think my earlier approach is correct, and the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively making \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each product will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each product will be a separate term with different \\(c\\) powers. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct either. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part must be 1, i.e., the constant term. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, that means I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.

But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify it another way. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) since it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts here. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you consider it as a monomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied, so it affects the coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they interact. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with various coefficients. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when multiplying the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Let me think differently. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, gives terms like 6 * (coefficient) * a^2b^2c^k or something. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify this with a different approach. Let me think about the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the product would have terms like 6a^2b^2c^k for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so it must be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check another way. Let me expand both parts separately. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), with coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 respectively. So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems correct, but let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, perhaps we need to evaluate \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of its coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, to get a numerical coefficient, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2.

The sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n4. Multiply 6 by 64 to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6.

Wait, no, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial will have a \\(c\\) term, which when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the second part contributes a term that is 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would be the term that doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), then the result would have some \\(c\\) power, which we don't want since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by the constant term) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms. So, as I thought earlier, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) factors. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer. But just to double-check, let me go through it again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the relevant coefficients from each part of the product and then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that means when I multiply the two expansions, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, correct. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(m = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient is 20, which is correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients for a specific term in one expression multiply the entire other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire product as a single expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do you find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? The sum of coefficients is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I would get the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is simply 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just part of the expression. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, because that's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is just part of the expression. But that doesn't seem right either because the entire product would have more terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. Wait, but let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, without considering the other part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Let me see if that makes sense. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial as above. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but specifically where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 120. Let me confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, as calculated. Then, multiplying by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term) because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.

However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, let me first confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
