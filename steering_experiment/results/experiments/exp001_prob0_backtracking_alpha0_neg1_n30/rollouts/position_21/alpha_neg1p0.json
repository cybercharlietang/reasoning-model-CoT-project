    "text": " But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication would just be a product of coefficients. Wait, but the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by this, the entire term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is just multiplied by this 6, but since it's being multiplied by another polynomial in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the 6 from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by this, it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in c)}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But coefficients are numerical, so perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check this with an example. Let's take a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose instead of 4 and 6, we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the product, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two expansions. So, that suggests that my earlier reasoning might be incorrect. Because in this small example, the coefficient is zero, not 2 times the sum of coefficients of the second expansion. So, that means that in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion with a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), but even then, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first expansion with \\(b^2\\) from the second, but the second expansion doesn't have \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the variables are separate. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion with a term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 * 2 = 4. But in reality, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that suggests that my reasoning is flawed. Therefore, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without also having some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that contradicts the earlier logic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the small example, the coefficient would be 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, the product doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expansion only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, you can't get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without a \\(c\\) term. Wait, but in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m\\) can be anything. So, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without also having some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero in that case. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is also zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without also having some power of \\(c\\). But that contradicts the earlier reasoning. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), we get terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms is of the form 6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is 6\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But in the small example, this would imply that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, the product \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without also having a \\(c\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is that in the small example, the exponent on \\(c\\) is 1, so the only exponents possible are \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), so you can't get \\(c^0\\), which would be needed to have a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, in the original problem, since the exponent on \\(c\\) is 6, which is even, perhaps there is a term with \\(c^0\\), which would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) to exist as a term without any \\(c\\) component. Wait, in the original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's see what the exponents of \\(c\\) are. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\). So, there is a term with \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by this constant term 20 would give \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's only one term. But earlier I thought that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But now I'm confused because in the small example, the sum of coefficients is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because only the \\(c^0\\) term would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as a term without any \\(c\\) component. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But wait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the small example, that would imply that the coefficient is 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality,"

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the other part of the product is 1, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), then you just get \\(a^2b^2\\). But if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate part and just consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying a constant. So, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other variables. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But actually, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it by that coefficient. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try a smaller example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\(a \\times c = ac\\), \\(a \\times 1/c = a/c\\), \\(b \\times c = bc\\), \\(b \\times 1/c = b/c\\). So, the term \\(a\\) appears as \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2. So, this approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   The total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply by \\(B\\), each term in \\(B\\) is of the form coefficient \u00d7 c^k, so when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, each term becomes 6 \u00d7 (coefficient) \u00d7 a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\u00b2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and the term \\(a^2b\u00b2\\) is present in all those products. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that. \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\): \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Is that the correct approach? Because in the product, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(A\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, and \\(B\\) has multiple terms, each of which has a coefficient. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 (coefficient from \\(B\\)). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by 6. Because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), each scaled by the coefficient from \\(B\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in \\(B\\)) = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and how the terms combine. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the other terms (involving \\(c\\)) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are multiplied by other terms. But no, actually, when you multiply, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expansion of \\(B\\) and sum the coefficients. Let me try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2k\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is indeed 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check if I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(A\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms in \\(B\\)? For example, suppose there's a term in \\(A\\) that's \\(a^3b\\) and a term in \\(B\\) that's \\(c^0\\) (i.e., constant term), would that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by any term in \\(B\\) would still have \\(a^3b\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, terms with higher powers of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) would not reduce to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(B\\), since \\(B\\) only has powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not affecting the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, my initial approach seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expression that has a \\(c\\) term, then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. That makes sense. So, first, we have the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), so just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because any other term in the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) term, which would make the resulting term have \\(c\\) in it, and since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute.

    "text": " But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall coefficient when multiplied by other terms. Wait, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the overall coefficient. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part just needs to be evaluated as a constant, so that the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is just the sum of all its coefficients, and then multiplied by 6. But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Because for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient gets multiplied by 6, and the sum of all coefficients in that expansion is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake by considering the sum of all coefficients. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\), which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is being multiplied, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial to get the total coefficient for that term in the product. So, if that's the case, then yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should double-check by expanding both parts separately and then multiplying. Let's try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are: when \\(k=0\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1*c^6\\); \\(k=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\); \\(k=2\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\); \\(k=3\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\); \\(k=4\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\); \\(k=5\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\); \\(k=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial), giving 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, to make sure, let's think about how polynomial multiplication works. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the resulting terms would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Now, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, yes, the coefficient is 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the expanded product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is determined by the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which has various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some constant term, i.e., when the \\(c\\) terms result in a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Wait, that makes more sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if \\(k = 0\\), then it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I expanded it and found the term where the exponent is 0. That occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. Multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the sum of coefficients would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems possible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Because when you multiply terms, the exponents add up. So, to get a term without \\(c\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which, when expanded, has various terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., then when I multiply them together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because the terms in the second expansion have different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not just the coefficients; they are coefficients multiplied by \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a monomial, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that monomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would make sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this another way. Alternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this, the total coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2 (since it's \\(c + 1/c\\), so when \\(c = 1\\), it's 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, yes, that works. So, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a product of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those would contribute to the overall coefficient.

So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct?

Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I found earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that the case?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion's contribution, but I think the reasoning holds. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as two separate expansions and see how the terms combine. Let me write it out more formally. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. Now, when this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}\\). So, for each term in the second expansion, which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the product with \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum over \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms could affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents? No, because \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come solely from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.

    "text": " But in this case, we're looking for a term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering the entire product, but only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) are multiplied by any terms from the second part. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering the entire expansion, but only looking at the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient in the context of the entire expression, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second part, which would be when \\(c\\) is set to 1. Hmm, maybe that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which might not make sense because usually, coefficients are constants. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that sum is just \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), because if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Wait, so maybe the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient, implying a numerical value. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the product as a single polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unusual because typically, coefficients are constants, not expressions in other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a product, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is expecting that as the answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part when their exponents add up correctly. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that can't be. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, and when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\).

But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient as a numerical value, but that seems impossible because \\(c\\) is a variable. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms in \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is just multiplied as a scalar. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, maybe the coefficient is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if the problem wants the coefficient as a numerical value or as a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, multiply it by 6, and that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To do that, we can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power) is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem might be expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the sum of the coefficients is when all variables are set to 1, but in this case, \\(c\\) is a variable, so maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem might be expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. I'm stuck here. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term is a power of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term in the second polynomial where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero and multiply it by 6. As I calculated earlier, that term is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we can treat the second polynomial as a constant, but that doesn't make sense because it's a variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) can be any value, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical answer, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by it, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic because the second polynomial affects the coefficients when multiplied. Wait, no, because in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\"

But wait, actually, that might not be the case. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the part of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are variables, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), but the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of the term that is 1 (i.e., the constant term) in the second part. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), that would give us terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part. So, let's compute both parts. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, and multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of it as the entire product's expansion having terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all combinations where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only happen when the term from the second expansion is the constant term, because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, making it not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion and then multiply by the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that can't be right because that would just give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the entire expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is a constant. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, to find this, I can consider the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), we can consider that term and see how it interacts with the other expansion. Specifically, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the other expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and those coefficients will add up. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients will each contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the other expansion, each of those products will be a separate term in the final expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems off because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\), which would affect the overall expression.

But no, that's not quite right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. But does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me double-check. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have the same \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). However, when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making them different terms. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That sounds right. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that's different from the 384 I thought earlier. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. The key was realizing that only the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making them different terms. So, the correct coefficient is 120, not 384. Let me confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2*3} = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two polynomials, perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied, would contribute a factor that is the entire expansion. But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the answer is simply 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion would contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as a sum of terms, each term being a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some integer k. When I multiply these together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the sum of those coefficients is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and I'm to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this by another method. Let's consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems like it would give a term involving \\(c\\) as well. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are part of the same expression, but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we just consider the product of the coefficients from each part, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression with \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall term. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) part is a red herring, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would still involve \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would involve \\(c\\) terms as well. But the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think about this again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means that in the product, we're only considering the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand both expressions fully, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of those would contribute to the overall coefficient. So, yes, 384 seems to be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any \\(c\\) terms, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because the expression involves \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express the problem: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a whole, but without considering \\(c\\). That is, maybe it's treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in the context where all variables are considered. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case. So, perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, and considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but considering all the terms, so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that seems too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient is supposed to be a numerical value, not a function of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), as each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when the entire expression is considered, but only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems too high. Wait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But that seems to be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., terms where \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a constant. In that case, I would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more plausible. Wait, let me check that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I want the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems less likely. Given that the problem is presented as a single expression, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables, but perhaps they just want the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a numerical value, which would require considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. Let me confirm that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and each term from the second part.

But that doesn't make sense because each term in the second polynomial has a \\(c\\) component. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient, it's actually the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the entire product would have terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's the same as substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the second expansion, which gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But no, that's not right because the entire product would have each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term, multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and every term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), all those terms add up their coefficients. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me just confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2 when c=1, which is correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. So, yes, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " But since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are only in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which has, let's say, some terms, then the product will have each term from the first multiplied by each term from the second. But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the term that is a constant (i.e., no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that constant term, I can multiply it by 6 (the coefficient from the first part) to get the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. And in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is at \\(m = 3\\), so that's 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a number, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these would have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate, meaning that the coefficient is actually the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the two parts are being multiplied, so the coefficients would multiply, but the variables would also multiply. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's a misstatement, and they just want the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the second part is multiplied, but since the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, first, let's find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part is somehow being ignored, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just extra. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me check that possibility. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me see if I can clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) alone doesn't include any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, or maybe it's just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Wait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. So, that would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the second part is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering the multiplication. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120, because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: Setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, actually, every term in the second expression will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps I can treat the second part as a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Because, in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, that's not the case. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could expand both parts separately and then find the coefficient. But that would take more time. Let me try that approach to verify. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I found earlier. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, the powers of \\(c\\) could affect the coefficient? For example, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), all those coefficients would add up.

So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each such term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a separate term, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all the contributions from the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, maybe the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems more plausible because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, so the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Let me check that. So, if I think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients is 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\), which would give the sum of coefficients as 64, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. When you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the sum of coefficients is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). But when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when you multiply by 6, you get 6 times the sum of those coefficients. Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, so the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that would make sense because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but no, because the second part isn't just a single term, it's a sum of terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. So, that would mean 6 times 64 is 384. Let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it's 1 times the entire second polynomial. But in the original problem, the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient as a numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only affected by the first polynomial, and the \\(c\\) terms are only affected by the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, and the second polynomial is a sum of terms with coefficients, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. As we calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Yes, I think that's right. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually expanding both parts. Let's take \\((a + b)^4\\). As we saw, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I'm confident with that answer now.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are attached to different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6 because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so it's just 6 times 1, but that doesn't make sense either because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one polynomial, and the \\(c\\) terms are in another. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), it must be multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the product would have a \\(c\\) term, which would change the term we're looking for. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I had considered the entire expansion, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's only affected by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients to be sure. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients add up. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it just adds a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. Because \\(c^0\\) would mean that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (if any), but actually, the second expansion doesn't have a constant term. Wait, let's check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from \\(6\\) down to \\(-6\\) in steps of 2. So, the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, but the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, only the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems more accurate. Let me confirm this. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, from the second part, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was a mistake because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which isn't the right approach. The correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
