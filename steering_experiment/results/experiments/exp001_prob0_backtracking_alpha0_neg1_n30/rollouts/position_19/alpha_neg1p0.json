    "text": " Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple in the product, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Let me explain. If I have two expressions multiplied together: one is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and all of those would be added together to get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0, because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But maybe the problem is more specific and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so that it's a term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the term is a pure scalar, not multiplied by any \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). So, I'm confused now. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But now I'm getting two different answers depending on whether I'm considering the sum of all coefficients or just the constant term. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. However, in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is present in the product, but it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense, as otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. The term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then include terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient. So, in that case, I need to consider both parts: the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. Let me think. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as we found. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which I'm now confused about. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant (with \\(c^0\\)). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That seems more plausible. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me just verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.

Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then this 6 is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the part where the \\(c\\) terms multiply such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, let me check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and thus multiplying by that would just give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero.

So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

So, the coefficient is 120.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but actually, that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), so the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that implies that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, we just want the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might be right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. But actually, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all terms will have exponents of \\(c\\) that are even numbers, either positive or negative. So, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by 20, because that's the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But in this case, since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. Because if you think about it, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the product terms have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms where \\(k \\neq 0\\) wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part isn't being treated as a constant; it's being multiplied term by term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), that would be 384. But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is way too high. Wait, so I must have made a mistake in that approach. Let me clarify. The correct way is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to think about the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying terms from both polynomials. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we have to multiply the coefficient from the first polynomial by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but that's not correct because the second polynomial's terms involve \\(c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the \\(c\\) part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) must be \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's correct. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be any term, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just part of the product. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? No, that can't be right because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2 \\text{ term}) \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the result would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're only interested in the terms where the \\(c\\) part cancels out, right? Wait, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a multiple of \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term doesn't have any \\(c\\) component. So, that would only happen if the second part is 1, but that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that in the product, the \\(c\\) terms must multiply in such a way that they result in a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that's possible. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part must contribute a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Because if the second part has a term like \\(c^k\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part must contribute a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., a constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the overall coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). So, \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, let me think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I consider the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term where the second part is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be \\(6\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s, that would mean that we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then will the product \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant term result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which is what we're looking for. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient 6 from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. So, let me work on that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20. So, when we multiply these together, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they're separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the coefficient in the entire expression, so the \\(c\\) part would just contribute a factor that's multiplied by 6. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, the terms will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a separate variable. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) part is just a constant multiplier. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has multiple terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in the second expansion has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would still be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not what the problem is asking for. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But let me verify this. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 (when \\(c = 1\\)). So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(a^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is indeed 1 times 2, which is 2. So, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms, which would be 6. But the presence of the other factor complicates things. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the final coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an unusual way to phrase the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be scaled by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 1, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I should consider the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems plausible. Let me confirm: In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term independent of \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is the product of two parts. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, the second part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but just \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have various terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that's the case. Wait, actually, no. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that's a term \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), and another term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-2}\\), and so on. So, each of these would be separate terms, but they all have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but maybe it's only considering the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the term, and the other part is from the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we can treat the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term, because when you multiply them together, each such product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part. But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, when I write out the product, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P is multiplied by every term in Q, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q) = 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20, since the constant term in Q is 20. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 384. But wait, let me confirm. Let me consider the expansion again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me clarify. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), the product will have terms \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have to consider all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, because each term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times 6. So, that's 6 * sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if we were to consider only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, since the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is correctly interpreted. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion another way. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) = \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}\\), etc., up to \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of it that way, I could expand \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) and sum all the coefficients. Let me do that:\n\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^6 = \\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3} + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(c^6\\): 1\n- \\(c^4\\): 6\n- \\(c^2\\): 15\n- \\(c^0\\): 20\n- \\(c^{-2}\\): 15\n- \\(c^{-4}\\): 6\n- \\(c^{-6}\\): 1\n\nSumming these: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), and I'm multiplying them, then when I expand, each term is a product of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each of those terms is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would only consider the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is in the original statement correctly. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, yes, it's only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second expansion, \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), gives me a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, since the second expansion is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by that coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that the entire product is a polynomial, and I'm to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which would then include all the \\(c\\) terms as coefficients. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that feels a bit off because the coefficient is typically a scalar, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to imply that the coefficient isn't a single number, but rather a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient when considering the product as a whole, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which would then include all the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that possibility. So, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we can proceed as follows. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as we found earlier. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, so maybe I'm adding something that's not there. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the problem's phrasing. Therefore, I think the most plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient is usually a scalar. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, strictly speaking, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient is the part that doesn't involve \\(a, b\\), but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we write the entire product, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because it's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about it differently. If I were to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but specifically the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found, and the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will just contribute a factor, but since we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant term in \\(c\\), perhaps only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering terms where the \\(c\\) parts are such that when multiplied, the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate part, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would affect the overall term. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), so the entire second part becomes 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it would give me a term with \\(c\\) terms, which isn't what we want. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the expression, and the \\(c\\) terms would be separate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate binomial expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c^k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all \\(c\\) terms, so the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me verify that. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be sure, let me think of it another way. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. This coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).

So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and wants the coefficient of that term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in each term of the expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. Let me check: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 2, because when \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient becomes 2. So, in that case, the method works. Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you have multiple variables, the coefficients might not just multiply like that. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and wants the coefficient of that term in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all the possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(1\\) (since \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\)) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), like \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), you need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the number of ways is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second expression. So, the final coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We are interested in the term that does not involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term \\(c^0\\).

The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, would give terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), does that mean the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a constant multiplier? Wait, no, because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, let me break this down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and realized that I needed the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - Expanding using the binomial theorem, the term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a term that's just a scalar, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and it gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, because that's the only term that when multiplied by 6a^2b^2 will give a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) simply the product of the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but only if the other parts don't involve variables. Wait, no, because the second part involves \\(c\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant. So, yes, I think 120 is correct. Let me double-check my calculations. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is separate, so the answer is 6. I think I'm stuck between two possibilities: 6 or 384. Let me try to think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

I think that makes sense because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 384. So, I think the answer is 384. Let me verify that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have some coefficient, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then perhaps we need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you get a term that's just a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. Any other terms in the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and in the second expansion, only the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the entire second polynomial is multiplied by this. But the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, each term in the second polynomial gets multiplied by 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just check with an example. Suppose I expand both parts and look for \\(a^2b^2\\). The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two polynomials together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, 90a^2b^2c^2, 120a^2b^2, 90a^2b^2/c^2, 36a^2b^2/c^4, 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Among all these terms, only the term \\(120a^2b^2\\) is the one where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that's the coefficient we're looking for. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied together. So, perhaps I need to consider the product of the two expansions. Let me think. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would involve multiplying each term of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the terms in the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to remain \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part gives 20 when considering the constant term, so when you multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as the product of the two, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part.

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, the overall coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give a number, but in reality, each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But wait, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, the terms from the first polynomial are multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the \\(c\\) expansion, you'd end up with a term that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a numerical factor, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the coefficient is typically a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all the terms together, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by 1, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That seems more plausible. So, the coefficient would just be 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check again. Let me think about the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for the coefficient of a term, they're referring to a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are not all 1. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But that seems like a stretch because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but if we're to present it as a coefficient, perhaps we can write it as 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the entire expression would have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me verify that reasoning. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, if we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. That makes sense. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is a numerical value. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the term, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6*20=120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving the constant term as \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part would just contribute a factor that is the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) terms aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Let me denote \\(X = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Y = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(X \\times Y\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(Y\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Y\\), each term contributes to a different term in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), all those terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when considering the entire product. Wait, no, actually, in the product \\(X \\times Y\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(X\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\). Because each term in \\(Y\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) part is 1, i.e., the constant term in \\(Y\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\(X\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\), because each term in \\(Y\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. When you multiply \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), each term in \\(X\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(X\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\). Because each term in \\(Y\\) is of the form coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, each with their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(X\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Y\\). So, I need to calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(Y = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Y\\), I get the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that: \\(Y(1) = (1 + 1/1)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Y\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(X \\times Y\\) is the coefficient from \\(X\\) times 64. Earlier, I found that the coefficient from \\(X\\) is 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\(X\\), and \\(Y\\) is multiplied entirely, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\), which is 64, giving 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), since each term in \\(Y\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term that only appears in one of the polynomials is the product of that term's coefficient and the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) only appears in \\((a + b)^4\\), so its coefficient in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Let me consider a simpler example: suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because each term in \\((a + b)^2\\) is either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), they become terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(ab c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Wait, but according to my earlier approach, the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times 2. But in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. So, my earlier approach might be incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my approach, it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's only up to \\(ab\\). Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term in \\((a + b)^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient in the product would be zero, which matches the actual result. So, perhaps my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^2\\), which aligns with my approach because the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero for \\(a^2b^2\\), so 0 * 2 = 0.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the approach seems valid. Therefore, I think the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not exactly correct because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The product is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is zero, which aligns with the approach because the coefficient from \\((a + b)^1\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, so 0 * 2 = 0.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\). In \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 * 4 = 12. Let me check by expanding: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these, the term \\(a^2b\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), so the coefficient would be 3 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 3 * 4 = 12, which is correct. So, this approach works.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which is the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) part.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms just get multiplied by 1? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the same as evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) would make each term just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is just a constant multiplier for the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion, which doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That might make more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But if we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the original problem didn't specify. Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1.

The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just be the entire expansion of that part, because it's a multiplicative factor. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me try to parse it again. The problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, as I thought earlier. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem mentions both \\(a, b, c\\), so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible.\n\nLet me check that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and specifically, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then I need to compute 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I'll compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but specifically, the \\(c^0\\) term is the one that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6, but given that the problem includes both \\(a, b, c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product, which would involve \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a, b\\) and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; it's an expression. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, as the second part is treated as a constant multiplier. But that seems inconsistent with the problem including \\(c\\) in the expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the answer is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But then, why include the second part in the problem? It seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term in the product is a combination of \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product has coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. If I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, 15a^2b^2c^2, 20a^2b^2, 15a^2b^2c^{-2}, 6a^2b^2c^{-4}, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20, but that's only if we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied. Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem including \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would involve all the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that's not possible because every term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\).

Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem says \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as if it's asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient when considering all terms, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That might make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve two steps: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. But if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then that would be an expression involving \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I was correct in the first place to consider only the \\(c^0\\) term, giving a total coefficient of 120.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be in \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something like that, but as it is, I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if we consider all powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes a product of two polynomials. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can consider that the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term involving \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), that would only happen if the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just contribute a scalar multiple. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, first, we found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's tackle that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k = 2\\), and the binomial coefficient is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient there is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part and then multiplying them. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (which is needed to isolate \\(a^2b^2\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the product is a sum of terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But if that's the case, then each term in the product will have a part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if I'm considering the product, then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the other expansion, each contributing a coefficient, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64, as I thought. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem isn't specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I calculated earlier, is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero), then we would need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 times 20 is 120. So, which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's the total coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific \\(c^k\\), but since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term has a coefficient, and when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by the 6, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
