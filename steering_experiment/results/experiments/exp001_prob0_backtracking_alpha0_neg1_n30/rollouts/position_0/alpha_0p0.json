    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, if I list out the terms, they would be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nOkay, so in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Let me write that out:\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\)\n\nSimplifying the terms, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to figure out what the exponents of \\(c\\) are for each term. Let me list them out:\n\n- When \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- When \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- When \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- When \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- When \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with exponents from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait a second, I just realized something. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut in the second expansion, all the terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor of 1, because any term multiplied by 1 doesn't change its coefficient. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only if the second term is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\)). Wait, no, actually, if the second term has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the entire term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term in the second expansion that will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAh, that makes sense! So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, as we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Looking back at the expansion, when \\(m=3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m = 6 - 6 = 0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in the product, each term is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. For the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term that has \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have an extra factor of \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but hold on, is that all? Let me think again. Because the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we have terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), \\(a^4c^2\\), etc., but when we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, but when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the only term in the product that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't be pure \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the entire expansion being the product of two separate expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Since the second part's constant term is 20, and the first part's coefficient is 6, multiplying them gives 120.\n\nJust to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. But since the second factor only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first factor times the sum of coefficients from the second factor. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term in the second factor is multiplied by the first factor's terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, because the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second factor, which would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is just 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. Similarly, the same theorem applies to expressions like \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only need to focus on the terms in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\), right? And since the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply the relevant coefficients together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will just multiply by the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think about this. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should check whether the multiplication with the second expression affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, actually, the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that any terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would be separate. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think this means that we're looking for the term in the expanded product where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in other words, in the product, each term will be of the form (some coefficient) * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or (some coefficient) * \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expression that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nTherefore, each of these will create terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4\\), etc. But when we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient from the first expression.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product will have a different power of \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expression will have different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first expression times the sum of all coefficients from the second expression. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expression has a different power of \\(c\\), so they don't combine with each other when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because if it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything else.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions. The first expression is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is exactly this term. So, I think that's correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can use this to expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only about \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Since the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum, but actually, each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just be a constant factor multiplied by that term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, we're looking for terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, and then the power of \\(c\\) can be anything, but we just need the coefficient for those specific \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single term. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is just extra. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the product of both expansions. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a coefficient that is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the product would have a specific power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical factors, not expressions with variables. Therefore, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is a red herring. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right either because the other part is a separate binomial expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then see how it interacts with the other expansion.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are the binomial coefficients, and their sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms. So, that would just be 6. But the problem includes the other part, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), so in the product, each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but in reality, in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I thought earlier, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients of \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a function of \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c"

But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nI think the key here is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the two polynomials are \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involve different variables: \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, \\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Since these variables are different, they don't interfere with each other. That is, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since these are separate variables, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, if I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms won't combine in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, adding their coefficients together.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) = A a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(Q(c) = B + C c + D c^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply them, the term \\(A a^2b^2 \\times B\\) will be \\(A B a^2b^2\\), and similarly, \\(A a^2b^2 \\times C c\\) will be \\(A C a^2b^2 c\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only be \\(A B\\) if \\(B\\) is a constant term, because otherwise, there will be other terms involving \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in our case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me expand that first. Maybe I can find the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), because that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in \\(Q(c)\\) would involve \\(c\\) to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, actually, the only term in \\(Q(c)\\) that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the constant term of \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with binomial coefficients.\n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting 6 - 2k = 0 gives k = 3, which is correct. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, so the constant term is 20. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine differently. But in this case, since the variables are different, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. All other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way might be to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. Since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are different variables, their expansions don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the variables match. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion.

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can definitely use the binomial theorem to expand it. The general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute that.\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the values, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\). Wait, so maybe I don't need to consider this part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts and multiply them together, the terms will be combinations of terms from each expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to figure out how this term interacts with the terms from the second part.\n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, in the product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving \\(c\\) would just be coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) raised to some power.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), does that mean that any term involving \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would just contribute to the coefficient as a constant? Or wait, no, because \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, but that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each possible power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part?\n\nWait, but that would give me the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is just considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's denote \\(T_1 = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(T_2 = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\), each term in \\(T_1\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(T_2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(T_1\\) (which has coefficient 6) is multiplied by every term in \\(T_2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(T_2\\) at \\(c = 1\\): \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. If I have \\(T_1 = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(T_2 = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product is \\(T_1 \\times T_2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(T_1\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When multiplied by \\(T_2\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the result would be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in \\(T_2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficients from \\(T_2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of \\(T_2\\). Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\), which is 384. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(T_2\\). Let me check that.\n\nIn \\(T_2 = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(T_2\\), each with their own coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is part of the expression, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(T_2\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c \\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(T_2\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term of \\(T_2\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(T_2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(T_2\\) multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(T_2\\), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's a product of two separate binomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me confirm by calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients as \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this ask for a specific term, but in this case, it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the expression is the product of both parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. But that would require summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expansions of binomials, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression has two parts multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe that part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly. Wait, but actually, since both parts are multiplied together, the entire expansion will be a product of the expansions of each binomial. So, every term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion.\n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then consider how it interacts with the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first polynomial, I need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial that are constants, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes sense. So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 multiplied by 20, which equals 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to pick the term in the second expansion that doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, which is the constant term. So, yes, that term is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me figure out which term that is. \n\nSince the exponent on \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), I can set up the equations:\n- \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\)\n\nSolving the first equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will have \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the coefficient for this term is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient we found from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the second part doesn't change the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the term in the second polynomial that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other power of \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, actually, I think I need to consider the second part as well. Because if I just take the 6 from the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but we only want the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because we don't want any \\(c\\) in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero. Let me figure that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term.\n\nThe coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the first part and the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. When you multiply these together, you get 120, which would be the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression because it's 6 from the first polynomial times 20 from the second, and there's no \\(c\\) term, so it's just 120.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first expression, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and the constant term from the second expression. Any other term from the second expression would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent, but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k\\) must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which gives 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but in this case, since the variables are separate, it's simpler to handle each part separately.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the expression separately.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, I can expand each part separately and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait a minute, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the \\(c\\) terms will just be coefficients multiplied along with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then consider how the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part affects it.\n\nLet me test this idea. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, do I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, not multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are distinct, so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the variables are different; they don't interact.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire coefficient, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating all variables as separate. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, because the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part, but that's not correct because each term in the product would be something like \\(6 \\times \\text{term from } c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it's actually 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, is the coefficient 384?\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a variable expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me test with a smaller exponent to see if this logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is as is. Multiplying, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product is indeed 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considered as coefficients, the sum is 2. So, that seems to check out.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is separate. But no, because the problem includes both parts, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, in the entire product, find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, along with \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term, and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me consider that. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that coefficient by 6.\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThen, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because the problem could be interpreted in two ways: either it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so it's probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify with a different approach. Let's consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's considering the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is just a multiplier, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be 6 times"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can use that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have two separate binomial expressions multiplied together. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait a minute, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I wonder if the second part will affect this coefficient. Let me think.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a specific term in the product, like \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it can be formed by multiplying terms from both expansions.\n\nBut here's the thing: \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms from the first part will be multiplied by terms from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the term \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me recalculate that. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion) gives:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, I considered that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Since any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would change the term we're looking for. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two binomials are multiplied together, each term in the expansion is a product of terms from each binomial. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first binomial and the constant term from the second binomial. There's no other way because if you take any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second binomial, you can't get rid of the \\(c\\) terms when multiplying by the first binomial, which only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 24a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 24a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the only term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of the constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging that into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and then find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part is multiplied by it, but it's a separate variable. Wait, actually, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, you're combining terms. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so they don't combine in a way that affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, we also have a factor from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible \\(m\\) values and sum their contributions. Wait, no, because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so they don't combine in a way that affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients are separate. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). The sum of the coefficients here is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by it. So, the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed, which is only when \\(k=2\\) in the first polynomial, and any \\(m\\) in the second, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 384.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k=2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), but no, that's not right because the second polynomial isn't being evaluated at a specific power of \\(c\\); the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, it's 6 multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 \\times 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient remains 6 because the second expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). However, since each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient is the product of 6 and the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first glance, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That takes care of the first part.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I'll apply the binomial theorem here. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to consider the second part at all when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, is that right?\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\), which are different variables, those \\(c\\) terms won't combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to form any other \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me make sure. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms at all. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because each multiplication by a term in the second expansion just adds a factor involving \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient is just scaled by the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant.\n\nWait, but that can't be. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the combined expression, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't contribute to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6, because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, but the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is considering the entire product as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term has a coefficient, and when you sum all those coefficients, you get 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nLet me verify that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the product is of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense.

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the results.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I'll use the binomial theorem here. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a second, but the problem is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I notice that in the second part, we're dealing with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms will just add as coefficients, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in each term of the product will only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by the second expansion, all the terms involving \\(c\\) just get multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{another thing}\\), then the product will be the sum of all possible products of terms from each expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only going to come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that seems confusing. Wait, no, the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product will have the exponents from both expansions. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just a constant. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that; it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be any term with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Hmm, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term will have exponents in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) exponent. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But in such problems, usually, if a term involves multiple variables, and you're asked for the coefficient of a specific combination, you might be looking for the sum over all possible exponents of the other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is purely in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me check that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require finding the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiplying that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that approach.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I had earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will occur when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any \\(m\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and for any \\(m\\), but the exponent of \\(c\\) would vary. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying the exponent of \\(c\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to 6.\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for confirmation. Let me see if I can find an example or a similar problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6.\n\nBut that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the term is just a constant. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems like a very large number, so maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, maybe I can test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\)\n\nMultiplying them together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\)\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), that would be zero, since there's no term with \\(a^2\\) and \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2 * (1 + 1) = 4? Wait, no, that doesn't match. Wait, actually, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)) = 2, which is indeed equal to the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^"

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nSo, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that's the expansion of the first part. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is one expansion, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another. Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I can focus on the part of the expansion that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) and then see how it interacts with the other part.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which has, say, some terms in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if any of those multiplications would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But actually, no, because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^2\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't change because we're only considering terms where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are exactly 2 and 2, respectively. The other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it just gets multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we have to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear. But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which is just the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients of each term in the second expansion are just the binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to sum all the coefficients of terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient from the second expansion corresponding to \\(c^k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to add up all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we calculated before, multiplying that by 6 gives 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key steps were:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2.

Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384.\n\nSo, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nLet me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that's the third term where \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.\n\nBut actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, if there's a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, the overall term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we're looking for.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Or is it? No, actually, in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider all possible terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), still result in a term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. But wait, the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain 2. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate part, and we're multiplying it by \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when we multiply the two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high, and I think I might be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), and the first polynomial involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different, so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I feel like that might not be the right approach.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the second polynomial doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial itself, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to find the coefficient when the product is expanded, but only for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded. When I multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Let me calculate that sum inside the parentheses:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 15 = 22\n\n22 + 20 = 42\n\n42 + 15 = 57\n\n57 + 6 = 63\n\n63 + 1 = 64\n\nSo, the sum is 64, as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's compute the entire expansion and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^5\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right) + 15c^4\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, summing up to 64.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me write it out again:\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are indeed 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, which sum to 64.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, the coefficients add up to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\)\n\nMultiplying them:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\)\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then I would sum the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which are 1 and 1, so total coefficient is 2. But the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, that seems to confirm the approach.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since the question is only about the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that's multiplied by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384?\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, and not the entire term, perhaps it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a coefficient, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each of those.\n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product will be products of terms from each expansion.

Or is it the coefficient times the entire expansion? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then each multiplication by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient, and the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * [each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)]. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, and not the variable part, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the other part is multiplied by 1, so the total coefficient is 6 times 1, which is 6. But that doesn't make sense because the other part is an expansion, not just 1.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, and not the variable part, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)^1\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I expand it, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (c + 1), which is c + 1, so the coefficient is 1 for \\(a^2c\\) and 1 for \\(a^2\\), so total coefficient for \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * 2 = 2. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the other expansion is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is the product of two expressions, so the coefficient would involve both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), which would change the exponent of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm. Let me clarify: if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it wants the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, which would be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). As I saw earlier, it's 1 * (1 + c) = 1 + c, so the coefficient is 1 for \\(a^2c^0\\) and 1 for \\(a^2c^1\\), so total coefficient for \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which is 1 times 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)^1\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can combine in different ways, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients, which is 64, then multiply by 6 to get 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.\n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, yes, the sum of coefficients is "

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((x + y)^n\\), the coefficients of specific terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this here.\n\nLooking at the expression, I see it's a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of multiplication.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. The entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I expand both parts, I'll have terms from each expansion multiplied together. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me first handle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWait, so each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since the entire original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. In other words, the second part's terms should not involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so they just contribute a coefficient that multiplies the existing coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but actually, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider the entire coefficient from both parts.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that means I can treat the second part as a single coefficient, because all the terms from the second expansion will just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), each contributing a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would need to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's consider the entire product. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because each term in the second expansion contributes a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they each create a distinct term in the product. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\) as part of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k=2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the same as multiplying the coefficients from each part, treating \\(c\\) terms as separate variables. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach. If I consider the entire expression as a product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so it's indeed 384. Let me confirm by looking at a simpler case.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0 because \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate from \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the highest power in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need at least \\((a + b)^4\\), as in the original problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms as part of the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by actually computing it. Let's compute the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) is as above. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, looking at the terms, the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 120a^2b^2. All other terms have some power of \\(c\\), so they are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, so my initial approach was wrong because I thought the problem wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but actually, it's only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I misinterpreted the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That means I need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nSo, let's correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by another method"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them somehow.\n\nFirst, let me focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\), right? So, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That should correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\).\n\nLet me compute that coefficient. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also looks like a binomial expansion, so I can apply the binomial theorem here as well. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but in this problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think these are separate variables. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nLet me think about that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will expand into various terms involving \\(c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expansion will just be a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in the final product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Because when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant coefficient, meaning the term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply that term by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, I'll get a term that is just \\(6 \\times \\text{constant} \\times a^2b^2\\), which is what I'm looking for.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors. If I had any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\).\n\nCalculating that term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, the first part contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 for the constant term. When I multiply these together, it's 6 * 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part multiplies the constant term from the second part, resulting in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   The constant term in this part is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So maybe I can use that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Similarly, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? Or do I?\n\nWait, no. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately from the others. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or maybe it's considering the entire product? Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all terms, but only the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are separate. So the terms in the first expansion only involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in the second expansion involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\), multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it means the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or does it mean the coefficient considering all possible \\(c\\) terms as well? Wait, no, because the expression is a product, so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for all terms where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the product becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(Q = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But actually, no, because each term in \\(P \\times Q\\) is a product of a term from \\(P\\) and a term from \\(Q\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is the sum of all coefficients where the exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\), which is 20, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Let me think again.\n\nIf I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(P \\times Q\\), that would mean I need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So in \\(P\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When multiplied by \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the product becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems correct if we're considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's different. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So the coefficient would be 384.\n\nBut let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\), which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so does that mean regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or specifically when multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? Hmm.\n\nWait, in algebra, when you have a product of two expressions, each term is a product of a term from the first and a term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression by each term in the second expression. So each such product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(Q\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\). So that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that would be the case if we're considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So the coefficient would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Suppose we're treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's different. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all the terms from \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), so the coefficient is 6 times that, which is 384 times each power of \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, but without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number, so perhaps it's considering the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, to clarify, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's the former: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. That would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me think of it another way. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this to both parts of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the first part of the product, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, the variables involved are different. So, does that mean I only need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider how the terms interact when multiplied together?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about how the two parts multiply. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply them, the terms from each expansion won't interfere with each other in terms of variable exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is asking just for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient? Or does it?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is a product, so when we expand both parts, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then will the term not involve \\(c\\) and just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when we multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient gets multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part is multiplied by this, I need to consider how it affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the product would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-6 + m}\\), but actually, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first expression is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is some number, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is another number, and their product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nBut wait, let me check that logic. Suppose I have two expressions, A and B. If I want the coefficient of a specific term in A, say \\(x^k\\), in the product A \u00d7 B, then it's the coefficient of \\(x^k\\) in A multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in B, because each term in B is being multiplied by \\(x^k\\), so the total contribution to \\(x^k\\) is (coeff of \\(x^k\\) in A) \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in B). Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, applying that here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is what I need to find first, and then I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two numbers together to get the final coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6, but actually, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) will range from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2, because each term is either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so actually, that term would only come from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only then would \\(c^0\\) multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c^k\\), that gives \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the product of two coefficients: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nSo, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nNow, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me focus on that part first. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. Hmm, does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times something? Or does the other part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the variables involved are different: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term in the second expansion that's multiplied by it.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided that the variables match. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has different variables. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product will not exist because every term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\) as well. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero because there are no terms without \\(c\\) in the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so maybe there's a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a power of \\(c\\) either positive or negative. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is an integer from -6 to 6. Therefore, there is no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems confusing. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) from the first part. Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me verify that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out is when \\(c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = c^0 = 1\\), and the coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two coefficients together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key was realizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion must be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), and that constant term has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We are looking for the term that is a constant (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Using the binomial theorem, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful.

Let me expand that part first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think the entire expression involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the coefficient we found. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, I think we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then realize that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term in the product, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the second expression has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. But that seems like a lot.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a product of two expressions, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to sum over all the coefficients from the second expression.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if we're just looking for the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second expression as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire second expression. But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're multiplying the entire second expansion by the first part, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we can consider that term separately from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can treat the second expression as a single term with a coefficient equal to the sum of all its coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the entire expression, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the context of the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps we're supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, then each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times Q(c), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", suggests it's looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms. But that would require more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expansion becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} 1^{6 - 2m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that the correct approach? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will have a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, and multiply by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would need to calculate it differently. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the approach is to sum over all coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 (by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? Or do I? Hmm, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me write down what I know. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then, since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it might just be a constant multiplier, so I can multiply the coefficient by whatever comes from the second part.\n\nWait, but hold on. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That expansion will involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I just need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part's expansion would just be a constant multiplier for that term. Hmm, is that right?\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second part's expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the second part just contributes a scalar multiple, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you expand the entire product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But no, that's not right because the coefficient is specific to the term \\(a^2b^2\\), so if the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c^k\\) terms. Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part just acts as a scalar, so the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a single number. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything? Hmm, the problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, I think it means that we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would result in a sum. But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a single number, not a sum. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not what the problem is asking; it's asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't being multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, the entire second part is being multiplied by the first part.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those contributions. So, the coefficient would be \\([ \\text{coefficient of } a^2b^2 \\text{ in } (a + b)^4 ] \\times [ \\text{sum of coefficients in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 ]\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by 64, that should give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's effectively treating the entire expression as a product where the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and that's the answer. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the second part, so I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems odd because the second part is part of the product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, as I calculated earlier, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, so the answer is 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but considering that the entire term could have other variables, but perhaps it's only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me compute that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, so the answer is 6, but that seems too simple given the presence of the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiplier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion has multiple terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, so the answer is 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those contributions. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit high. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write out the expansion for this part. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients from the second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part. But wait, actually, no, because I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider all the possible terms in the second part, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't just a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps they just want the coefficient from the first part, 6, without considering the second part. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so perhaps they just want the coefficient from the first part, 6, and then the second part's expansion would contribute a factor that's multiplied by 6, but since they're asking for the coefficient, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems confusing because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but they are only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), making the entire term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. When you multiply these together, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6a^2b^2. The term \\(c^0\\) from the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me break down the problem into two parts: the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, I can expand each separately and then see how they combine.\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for that term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't directly affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't influence the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion, right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when multiplying two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\).\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would include all those terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever power of \\(c\\) comes with it. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms in \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But that's not a single coefficient; that's a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That makes more sense because then it's a single term with a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would involve taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNext, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial expansion again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the first expansion? No, because the first expansion only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't interfere with each other's variables. So the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would be incorrect because the problem likely expects a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), making it a standalone term.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those products, meaning 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find the term where \\(c^0\\), solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of specific terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the relevant terms together to find the desired coefficient.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the variables in each binomial are different (a, b, c, 1/c), the terms involving a and b won't interfere with the terms involving c and 1/c. That means I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients for the respective terms.\n\nSo, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of a term here that, when multiplied by the corresponding term from the first part, will result in the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the c terms should cancel out (i.e., exponent 0).\n\nWait, let me clarify. Actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c. But wait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". But in the entire product, each term will have powers of a, b, c, and 1/c. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2, and the exponents of c and 1/c can be anything, but when multiplied together, they result in a term with c^0 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just that; it doesn't involve c). Wait, is that correct?\n\nActually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be accompanied by any combination of c terms. But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. Hmm, that seems a bit unclear. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some c term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of c, which isn't specified.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any c terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the c terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with c, which would make the coefficient dependent on c. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion has terms with different powers of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c term. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each of which has some power of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because usually, when asking for the coefficient of a specific term, you might also specify the exponents for other variables. Since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting the sum over all c terms, making the coefficient 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be different.\n\nLet me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all c terms, which might not be intended.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do this, I'll first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which we've already determined is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of c to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But now I'm considering that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being asked.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any c terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting c=1, which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2, regardless of the exponents of c. In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nHowever, I'm starting to think that maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a constant multiplied by various powers of c, which wouldn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. In this case, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify the c terms, I'm leaning towards the first interpretation, but I'm not entirely sure. However, in many problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, they often mean the term where the exponents match exactly, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where k ranges from 0 to 4, and m ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by any possible c^m term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all m of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a constant, not depending on c. But in reality, each term in the product would have a different power of c, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in c, unless we're considering the coefficient when c^0 is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. Therefore, the answer would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let's think about the structure of the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. That is, 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c=1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of c. So, in the entire expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c would have a coefficient of 384. But that's not possible because the coefficients in the second expansion vary depending on the power of c. For example, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6*1=6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have a coefficient of 6*6=36, and so on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for each specific c term would be 6 times the coefficient of that c term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify:\n\nThe first expansion: \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nThe second expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\"

    "text": " Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the given expression.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, that means in the binomial expansion, the term where \\(k = 2\\) because \\(b\\) is the second term. \n\nUsing the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term would be \\(6a^{4 - 2}b^{2}\\), which simplifies to \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I also have to consider the expansion of the second part? Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). \n\nLet me think. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will only come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because they are separate variables. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{something else}\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a standalone term; when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will just have factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains the same. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't a single term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number, but an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's just a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But that would complicate things because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, meaning that the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than intended. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then considering the second part as a separate expansion, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because if we consider the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and unless \\(k=0\\), it wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nThat makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(1/c\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is \\(20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, so when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the variables are separate. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which gives 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion will have a factor of \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe I can focus just on the first part for this term.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, every term from the first expression gets multiplied by every term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion, and since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all those contributions.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then that term can come from any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're collecting all coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to sum them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simpler to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by the entire second expression, each term in the second expression adds another factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient just scales by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64.\n\nNow, going back to the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because we choose 2 \\(a\\)s and 2 \\(b\\)s. Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first expression, and any term from the second expression would just multiply it by their coefficients. So, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expression, which is indeed 64, and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when we multiply this by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when we multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these terms, we get 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{6 - 2k}. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), but when we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, and since these are all separate terms, we have to add them all together. But that's exactly the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) where \\(m = 6 - 2k\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, which gives us 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply it by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the terms where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just that term without any \\(c\\) factors.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct either because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only appear if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's equal to 1, because \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\). But is there such a term?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be obtained by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, to get the overall coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by multiplying the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again.\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n3. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20.\n4. Multiplying these together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way this could happen. Could there be other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by terms from \\((a + b)^4\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there's a term with \\(c^k\\) and another term with \\(c^{-k}\\) that when multiplied together give \\(c^0\\), but that would require considering cross terms, but in reality, each term in the product is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product is a product of a term from each expansion. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, as any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), neither of which is \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yes, my initial approach was correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion.\n\nLet me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\), but the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors is when \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term from \\(B\\) is the constant term, which is 20.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me calculate that coefficient using the binomial theorem.\n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part of the expression might not affect the coefficient because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, I'll have terms from each multiplied together. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)), because otherwise, the term would include \\(c\\) terms, which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can't have a constant term unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to check if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. That is, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by 20 from the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the constant term from the second part, since any other term from the second part would include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term**:\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - For the term to be constant, \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\).\n   - The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
