    "text": " 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me tackle the second part. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the second polynomial? For example, if I take a term with \\(c\\) from the second polynomial and a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first, would that affect the coefficient? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) by the \\(c^0\\) term (with coefficient 20). Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, so those wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is the question asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? So, when we multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, yes, only the term where we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * (c + 1/c)^6's constant term, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, but wait, I think I might be missing something. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the product have \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term of the second expression, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me work on the second part now. So, I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion, so that's correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations.
