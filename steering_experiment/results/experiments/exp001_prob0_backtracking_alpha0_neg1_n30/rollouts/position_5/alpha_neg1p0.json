    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, in the binomial expansion, that would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Yep, that's right. So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that, \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so it's \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient I just found, 6, is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other part? Or do I need to consider the other part as well? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the variables in the two parts don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the coefficients from the first part, and the second part can be anything because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term, it's a sum. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only exists in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by anything from the second part, it just adds a factor, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's multiplied by it from the second part, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is \\(c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Because each term in the second part is a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to a different term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But each such multiplication would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the term is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, you'll have \\(c\\) terms attached.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger expression that includes \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but only looking at the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way to get a term with exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but I should make sure that's the correct interpretation. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is any term from the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider the variables as separate. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you have an extra \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120.\n\nLet me just confirm by expanding both parts:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that:\n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 * c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the second part is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the first part by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the only term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the entire expansion. But I think"

Using the binomial theorem, that would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, I get:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider the product of these two expansions. \n\nHmm, so I think I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\)? Or do I need to consider all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion?\n\nWait a second, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, you'd be adding a lot more terms. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing something here. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient. But that doesn't seem right either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when you multiply it by terms involving \\(c\\), you just get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. \n\nWait, so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), I just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term, which would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nLet me check that. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts, I can write it as the product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), it will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the only term that has just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) is when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), you get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), because all other terms will have factors of \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), making them not purely \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion to give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n4. The result is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in that reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the coefficients will multiply. So, the overall coefficient of a specific term will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, provided the variables match. \n\nWait, but in this case, the variables are different. The first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are separate. That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the first expansion don't affect the terms in the second. \n\nWait, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiplier. \n\nWait, but that can't be right either because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients don't just add up. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come up is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOh, that makes sense! Because if we take any other term from the second expansion, it would have a power of \\(c\\) which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and we need to multiply that by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the \\(c\\) part is 1 (the constant term). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, right? That would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. \n\nWait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of the second part is? But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible terms from the second expansion. \n\nBut that seems a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem just asks for a coefficient, which is a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to consider the product and find the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut then, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then the rest is just multiplied as a constant. But that doesn't make much sense either. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term in the second expansion. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out). So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. \n\nOkay, so let's work on that. First, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6, but that doesn't account for the other part. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the second part is. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's likely that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we found to be 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient here is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so the overall expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product. But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables in \\(P\\), and \\(c\\) is a variable in \\(Q\\). Since they are different variables, when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way for a term to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) by any term in \\(Q\\). But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), each contributing a different power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But that seems confusing because \\(Q\\) is a separate variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're essentially scaling the entire \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Because if so, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(c\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which is a variable, and coefficients are typically constants.\n\nSo, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nAlright, so first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the overall expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a term of \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times 20? Or is it more complicated? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients from all the terms in the second part, but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the constant term in the second part. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless we're considering all powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But that seems contradictory because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a constant.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this another way. Let's consider the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\) will have a coefficient of 6, \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\) will have a coefficient of 6*6=36, \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6*15=90, \\(6a^2b^2\\) (the constant term) will have a coefficient of 6*20=120, and so on for the negative powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 120, and that's the answer we're looking for.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then it's the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6*20=120.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** Using the binomial theorem, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, plugging that in, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly interested in the \\(c\\) terms because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Or do I need to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because they're separate variables. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider specific terms in the second part that might affect the coefficient?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a separate variable term, so when I multiply it by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps all the terms from the second part will just contribute a factor to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those coefficients, because each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, because when you expand the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense, perhaps. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(k=0\\) to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). But the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems contradictory because if I consider only the \\(c^0\\) term, it's 120. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be any term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not the case because the problem just asks for the coefficient, implying a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * (c + 1/c)^6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense, and in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's intended to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make the coefficient a number, 120.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which isn't the case in the problem statement. So, I'll go with that approach.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me try expanding both parts and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6*15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) would be 6*20 = 120, and so on for the negative powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6*(sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6*64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which seems high, but let's see.\n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expression, then in the product, this term will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient is a polynomial. But that's not the case because the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, let me confirm by calculating it another way. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes with a coefficient of 6. Now, in the second part, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

Simplifying the binomial coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the terms. Specifically, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so maybe I should think about how the terms from each expansion multiply together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the variables multiply as well. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that is a constant, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nWait, no, actually, let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how the multiplication affects the variables. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either. But wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms with powers of \\(c\\), so unless we multiply by a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero, which would make it a constant term, the product would have terms with \\(c\\) involved. \n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then we would be multiplying by all terms, which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nYes, that makes more sense.

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us 20 for the constant term. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another binomial expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think about it. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut here's the thing: the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I don't think they affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. \n\nBut that can't be right because the second part is an expression, not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-read the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, in the product, when you expand both expressions, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Because if you take any term from the second part that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. \n\nActually, \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. When you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me recap: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expression. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the constant term in the second expression is the only term that doesn't introduce any additional variables, so it's the one that allows \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any extra \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, I'm pretty confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2.

So, I think I need to consider both parts together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but when I multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient might change because I'm multiplying the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right. Because the two parts are multiplied together, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms involving both \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that seems off because the second part's coefficients are not constants; they depend on the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That might make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two results together to get the final coefficient. \n\nSo, first, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that's the same as what I did before. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct.

That's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6}\\) wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so it's 720 divided by (6 * 6) which is 720/36, which is 20.

So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is indeed the sum of all coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when we multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients for the product will multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part, when multiplied, will just add up their coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, we substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, it should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, maybe the multiplication doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? \n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, in this case, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? \n\nWait, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so when we multiply by the second part, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all the coefficients from the second expansion and add them up? Or maybe not, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire second expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by the entire second expression, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in the second expansion, which would give you terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k and 6a\u00b2b\u00b2(1/c)^k for each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we are considering the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, then when multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, to recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should expand both parts and see. But expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would take time. Alternatively, I can note that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut when I multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) with coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for any integer \\(m\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) part, that would mean adding up all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Actually, each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) part, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you don't specify the power of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have an infinite number of coefficients corresponding to different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I mentioned earlier, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nSo, which interpretation is correct? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nHmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, unless specified, I think it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's often implied that you're looking for the term where the other variables have zero exponents. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I think the more likely interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this. Suppose we have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, from the second part, we need \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) to be \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the combined coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with any power of \\(c\\), then that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I think in the context of the problem, they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product multiplied by each term of the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me clarify. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, the coefficient when you collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, which one is it? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nIn standard math problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions with multiple variables, unless specified, it's usually considering all possible combinations of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nLet me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both 1 and c. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nSo, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2). \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 64), giving 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the term where \\(c^0\\). So, which is it? \n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nIn standard terminology, the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials is the sum of all coefficients where the variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * "

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficients will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. \n\nOkay, so the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider that as well. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients? Hmm, let me think.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply together. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then I multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then each term in the product will have a factor of \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean we need to consider all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, actually, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, that expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are of the form \\(a^kb^m c^n\\) or \\(a^kb^m c^{-n}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expression, the coefficient would just be that 6 multiplied by the entire expansion in \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not the sum.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would mean considering the product. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expression, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, that suggests that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, and the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to the overall term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nOkay, so first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that.\n\nThe expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be asking for the coefficient where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be interpreted. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\). That would mean treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not an expression. So, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)\" for some specific \\(k\\), then that would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct as well.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Let me think about this. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will depend on the coefficients of the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. \n\nBut here's the thing: the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't actually need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, unless there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by that constant would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If there's no constant term, then the coefficient would be zero because all the terms would have some power of \\(c\\) attached. \n\nWait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the constant term, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. That means when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). But wait, is that the only contribution? Let me think. \n\nWhen I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the constant term (i.e., when \\(k=3\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term of 20. So when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving me \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me see. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider the other terms in the expansion. The other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) would give me terms with higher or lower powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the other expression. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we've calculated both coefficients as 6 and 20 respectively, their product is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, resulting in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nTo find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), we solve:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the third term, right? Let me calculate that. The binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only comes from the first part, then in the product, this term will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems wrong because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\). But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient is supposed to be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the expression is a product of two separate expansions, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient would be a term involving \\(c\\).

Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient is supposed to be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering all variables. So, if I expand both parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which would be 384, but that seems high.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require multiplying the coefficients from both expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correctly written, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms in the product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But again, that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that's not correct because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's just a multiplier.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense.\n\nAssuming that's the case, let me proceed. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need this exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but given that, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the product. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the other terms in the expansion that involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I can actually treat these two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients. \n\nLet me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we just need the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient will be 6 times whatever the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that's not quite right. \n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we have to find the terms in the second part that are constants (i.e., have \\(c^0\\)). Because only those terms, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. \n\nAlright, so let me work on that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). Since when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\), which is 20, then yes, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me compute those coefficients. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(1 \\cdot a^4\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\). Next, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so that's \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so \\(4ab^3\\), and finally, \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so \\(b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider how this term \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is just a constant, right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it would change the term, but if I multiply it by a constant, then the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expression, it will create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term shouldn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) parts. So, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give me a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. \n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving us \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two polynomials, so each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and no \\(c\\) terms, the only contributing term from the second polynomial is the constant term. So, yeah, that makes sense. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\n3. Find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\n4. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n5. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, yeah, I think that's correct. \n\nWait, just another thought: since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when we multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s, we need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That constant term is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if we were looking for, say, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), that would be 6 * 15 = 90, because the term with \\(c^2\\) in the second expansion has a coefficient of 15. But in our case, we're only interested in the constant term. \n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nI guess another way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve the other variables. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients just get multiplied by the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion. \n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n- Constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n- Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). I can calculate the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)! ) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just part of the expansion of the first part, and then we have to multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean we need to consider how the second part affects this coefficient? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part?\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that means that any terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would still be part of the overall expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, but perhaps it's a misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. Let me check the original problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's a typo or a misstatement, but perhaps it's intended to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the answer would then be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me think about that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a product, and considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which, as I thought earlier, is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nLet me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to find that, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, first, from the first part, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the constant term. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so maybe I'm assuming too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can think of this as a product of two independent expansions. So, any term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-m}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, each term from the first expansion is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term from the second is \\(c^m \\times c^{-n}\\), but actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I expanded earlier, gives terms \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers from -6 to 6.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is also found using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Each term will have a binomial coefficient. I remember that the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, let's compute that coefficient. \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of both binomials. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(c\\) terms will just be along for the ride, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficients in the second expression depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product. So, when you expand the entire expression, you have terms that are products of terms from each binomial. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. But wait, no, actually, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second expansion depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), so when collecting all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expansion and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, as in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, that seems more straightforward. Let me think: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients of the variables in one don't affect the coefficients of the variables in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first polynomial, which is 6. Because the second polynomial only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I was overcomplicating it before. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused now. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, a general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, for each such term, we also have the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product contributes to the coefficient, so the total coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is being multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied by it, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the question was only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient where \\(c\\) is also to the power of 0, which would involve more steps. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) times 1 (from \\(b^2\\)), but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, in this case, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because in the original problem, I thought the coefficient would be 384, but in this simpler case, it's zero. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without also having some \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be zero. \n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a separate variable, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But in the simpler example, I saw that the product doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because each term in the product includes a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the confusion arises because in the original problem, the variables are separate, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, so when you multiply, each term in the product includes both an \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) part and a \\(c\\) part. Therefore, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the product, every term will have some combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself doesn't exist in the product because it's always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term in the expansion. \n\nBut that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), when I expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. Therefore, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present, and when you multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), you're just adding more factors, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in reality, each of those terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering \\(c\\), would be zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the simpler example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there are no terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the confusion is about whether the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or not. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you expand the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. Therefore, the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient equal to the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\"

For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, that becomes:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, that means I need to consider the entire product. So, I can't just take the 6 from the first part because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to think about how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's going to contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must be multiplied by a term that is effectively \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient?\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find two things:\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, I can multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nStarting with the first part, as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\nSimplifying the exponents, that becomes:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, we need to solve for \\(k\\) in the equation:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). When I multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can think of the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I'm effectively multiplying 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20, that term is 20. So, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first term, and the second term is multiplied by it, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second term? Or do I need to consider any interaction between the two?\n\nWait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The problem says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. When we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a monomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that monomial. So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct either. Let me think: when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which suggests it's a scalar. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, but it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient would include terms from \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more involved. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term could be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6, a^3b c^4, a^2b^2c^2\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a scalar. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a scalar.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\), with no \\(c\\) involved. So, let's assume that's what the problem is asking for, even though it's not explicitly stated.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find this, we can consider the product as two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). The coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion.\n\nFrom the first part, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, how do we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and assuming it's considering the term without \\(c\\), the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, my initial assumption that it's asking for the constant term in \\(c\\) is correct. So, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, then the answer would be 6. But given the structure of the problem, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which would involve considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. That means I can't just take the coefficient from the first part alone because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. \n\nSo, maybe I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider how that term interacts with the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means that I'm only concerned with the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering all the variables together, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one part, and the other part is the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some expression involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for just the coefficient, so perhaps it's treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient would be a term that's a product of coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that is, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then the product will have terms like \\((\\text{terms from } (a + b)^4) \\times (\\text{terms from } (c + 1/c)^6)\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m - 6}\\), depending on how the second part is expanded. \n\nWait, but in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - n} \\times (1/c)^n = \\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, each term in the second part is a coefficient multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2n}\\) where \\(n\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible terms in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a sum over all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because if we're looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then we need to find the part of the product where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that reasoning. If I expand both expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if I want the term where \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, then I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nThe exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about it another way. If I consider the entire product, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) depends on the term from the second expansion. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(k=2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is fixed, and the rest is determined by the second part. \n\nBut since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^m\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to consider only the constant term, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, regardless of the other variables. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation must be that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).

But that's not right either because the variables are different. \n\nWait, let me think again. The variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\).

But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by an expression, the coefficients get scaled by the entire other expression. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficients from the second expression will just add up, but since they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), they are constants.

The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the terms in the second expression are in terms of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm still confused because earlier I thought that the coefficient remains 6, but now I'm getting 384. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these has the same \\(a^2b^2\\) part but different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, if we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first part (\\(a + b)^4\\)) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients from the second part is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer. But let me verify this another way. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the coefficients combine. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The sum of all coefficients here is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Suppose I consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Since the second expansion has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when \\(c = 1\\), is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, that part is fine. \n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as calculated earlier. \n\nSo, multiplying these together, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. Specifically, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. \n\nLet me write that down. So, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means I need to consider the entire product. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from the first part times 1 from the second part?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for all the terms in the product that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when you multiply it by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms will all have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are reciprocals, perhaps we need to consider that when multiplying, the exponents of \\(c\\) might cancel out. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. But in reality, the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and each term in the second expansion is multiplied by that 6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be 6 times a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because that's the only term that would give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. But that seems like a lot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the term from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\\). Now, this term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\(6 a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), we get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that's multiplied by 6. \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But if that's the case, then the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^k\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like the entire product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, but that's because \\(c\\) is a variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient as a polynomial, not a numerical value. But the problem asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's a numerical coefficient, implying that we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when \\(m = 3\\), we have \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. So, maybe the problem is asking for that. Let me confirm.\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 3} \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. Hmm, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try to write it out more formally.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). \n\nNow, when you expand \\(P(a, b)\\), you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Similarly, expanding \\(Q(c)\\) gives terms \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nWhen you multiply \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 38"

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero because otherwise, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to rephrase, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the product of these two coefficients will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, so let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6! / (3!3!) is (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when multiplied together, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, any term in the product will be of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and the term from the second expansion that doesn't affect the a and b terms is the constant term, which is 20. So, multiplying these together gives 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations. For the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we set 6 - 2k = 0, so k=3, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a minute, so does the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. \n\nSince the second part is multiplied by the first part, and the first part already has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, when we multiply by the second expression, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider how \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because \\(c\\) is a different variable. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variable \\(c\\) doesn't interfere with that. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the multiplication won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Maybe it's simpler than that. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) in the product is equal to the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. \n\nLet me compute that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check. Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some multiple of \\(c^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have the same coefficient as in the first polynomial times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have different variables. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only present if there's a term in the second polynomial that is 1, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless... Hmm, does it?\n\nWait, let me check if \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term. The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We set this equal to zero to find the constant term: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second polynomial, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is to multiply by the constant term 20. All other terms in the second polynomial would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me go through this again carefully.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, say P(a, b) * Q(c), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from terms in P(a, b) that are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by terms in Q(c) that are constants (i.e., terms without any variables). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in Q(c). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so my initial thought that it's 384 was wrong because I incorrectly assumed that all coefficients in Q(c) contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, only the constant term in Q(c) contributes because otherwise, you'd be introducing other variables. So, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply this by each term in the second sum and then add them up. However, only the terms in the second sum that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nAs we found earlier, the constant term in the second sum occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 (from the first polynomial) by 20 (from the second polynomial) gives 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering all coefficients, but now I realize that only the constant term in the second polynomial affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficients for each term can be found using combinations.

But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) will combine in different ways. \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider how the coefficients from both expansions contribute. \n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each coefficient in the second expansion gets multiplied by 6 and then attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to all the terms in the first expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let's take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, right? Because \\(a\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient for \\(b\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, yes, that seems to work. Therefore, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion's coefficients, but that would make the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion). So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when multiplied, each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1*(1 + 1)=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1)=4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1)=2. So, yes, each coefficient from the first part is multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists in the product. Since in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but that's exactly what I did earlier. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any negative signs or anything. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so all the coefficients are positive because both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are positive when \\(c=1\\), so the sum is 64. So, no issues there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me compute the entire expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. The expansion is:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 =7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, yes, the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 ="

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about this. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve the variable \\(c\\). That means I need to find the terms in the second expression that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. In other words, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because multiplying by a constant won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term; it will just scale its coefficient.\n\nSo, I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). That gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so it's 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) which is 36. So, 720 \u00f7 36 is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, \\(6a^2b^2\\) times 20 gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. The key was realizing that to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the constant term from the second expression because any other term involving \\(c\\) would introduce variables that aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, by finding the constant term, which is 20, and multiplying it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get the final coefficient of 120. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The steps seem logical: expand each part, find the necessary coefficients, and then multiply them together since they are independent of each other. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, expanding this, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nThis means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, I think I need to be careful here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by any term from the second polynomial, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but we only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me verify this. Because another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the second part, when expanded, has terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. However, since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check this another way. Let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's not correct because the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but in that case, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of any term in the second polynomial, but since we're not specifying any power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. The second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\). The sum of its coefficients is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Now, let's compute the actual product:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nLooking for terms with \\(a^2\\), which are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). The coefficients are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches our earlier calculation. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as before. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of these, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because \\(c^0\\) would leave the term as \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I take 6 * 20, that's 120. But this contradicts the earlier result of 384. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I'm confused now. So, in the smaller example, when I took the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), which is 1, and multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which was 2, I got 2, which matched the actual expansion. But in this case, if I take the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, and multiply by 6, I get 120, but that's not matching the 384.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by that term, resulting in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, when I took the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), which is 1, and multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which was 2, I got 2, which was correct because the product had two terms with \\(a^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product was 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, why did I get a different answer when I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)? Because in that case, I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is not asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\)), which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the entire expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 20a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 1a^"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Each term will have a coefficient given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) where \\(k\\) is the power of \\(b\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me calculate that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is that this expression is multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is commutative, the coefficients multiply as well. But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), they don't interfere with each other. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times some polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the question is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term would only appear if the second factor contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because then \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If there's a \\(c^k\\) term with \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\). That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these are independent parts, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. But only the term where the second expression contributes a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have two separate binomial expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120, which should be the correct coefficient. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the terms where the variables' exponents add up appropriately. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's why we only need to multiply those two coefficients together. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that a bit. The expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, as expected, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only when it's multiplied by the constant term (20) will the result be a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other multiplications will introduce a factor of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which changes the term to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, which gives 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. It's a bit tricky because you have to consider that the variables are separate, but once you realize that, it's just a matter of finding the relevant coefficients in each expansion and multiplying them together. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so their coefficients multiply when looking for specific terms. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second polynomial that affects it is the constant term. \n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
