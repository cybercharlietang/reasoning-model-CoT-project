    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of that second part as well.\n\nLet me denote the second part as \\(D = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, expanding \\(D\\):\n\n\\[\nD = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion of \\(D\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Let me write out the terms to see the exponents of \\(c\\):\n\n- When \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, \\(D\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) with terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(D\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(D\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and how it interacts with the terms in \\(D\\).\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, and the coefficients multiply as well. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the ways that when we multiply terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(D\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, right? So, we need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients from each term in \\(D\\) multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times D\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(D\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(D\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in all these terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all the coefficients from these terms. So, that would be 6 (from \\(c^6\\)) + 36 (from \\(c^4\\)) + 90 (from \\(c^2\\)) + 120 (from \\(c^0\\)) + 90 (from \\(c^{-2}\\)) + 36 (from \\(c^{-4}\\)) + 6 (from \\(c^{-6}\\)).\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me calculate that. So, adding them up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Because if that's the case, then we only need to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(D\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, I think my initial approach was correct, and the coefficient is 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem mentions both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so maybe it's intended to consider the coefficient in the entire expansion, but perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the sum of 6 times each coefficient in \\(D\\), because each term in \\(D\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and each of these contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one gets multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will indeed be multiplied by every term in \\(D\\), each contributing to different terms in the product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, all those terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of their term, so their coefficients will add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because, for example, if I have \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), that's a different term than \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, each of these would be separate terms, but when you collect like terms, the only like term for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the one where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, because otherwise, the exponents of \\(c\\) are different. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from each term in \\(D\\) multiplied by 6, because each term in \\(D\\) is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(D\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(D\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(D\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(D\\) is 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Alternatively, since each term in \\(D\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the sum of the coefficients in \\(D\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that maybe the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I'm a bit confused now. Let me see if I can clarify this.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the entire product, we're looking for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would include terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\), but they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense that when you collect like terms for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from these terms.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term is unique in terms of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(D\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, because only the constant term in \\(D\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) term.\n\nBut the problem as stated is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when problems involve multiple variables, they might be asking for a specific term where all variables have certain exponents, but in this case, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific exponent for \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(D\\), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have the product of two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let me denote the entire expression as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two sums, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the product of the coefficients from the first sum and the second sum where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2.\n\nWait, but in the first sum, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, only when \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the coefficient from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), and each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second sum, we get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) would give me the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). That means the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nOkay, so in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 a^2 b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means I also need to consider the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI think I need to expand this second part as well and then multiply it by the first part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all terms from the second expansion. Instead, perhaps I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But wait, that might not be the case because the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Hmm, that doesn't sound quite right because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, the variables are different, so when you multiply the two expressions, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, and the rest can be anything. But that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of expressions, you have to consider that the other variables can be anything, so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If I have two separate expressions, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply them together, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and since \\(c\\) doesn't appear in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of all terms in the second expansion isn't a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of products, each involving a term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all distinct variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of, say, \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part is the middle term of the expansion. Wait, that makes sense because if I take the constant term from the second expansion, then when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), I get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that seems more accurate. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two terms together, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first expansion gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second expansion gives us a constant term with a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

    "text": " Let me write out the expansion for that.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, I get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, that's:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the original problem is the product of this expansion and another expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) alone; I need to consider how the multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because actually, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving powers of c, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, we need to consider whether the terms involving c will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without c, so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where k is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c. That means we need to find the part of the product where the c terms cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of c is zero. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when k = 3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first expansion gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion has a constant term of 20, so when I multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied entirely, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve c, which is the constant term. So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me write out the entire product.\n\nThe product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't have any c terms, meaning the exponent of c is zero. So, yes, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) correctly. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when 6 - 2k = 0, k = 3, so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is exactly what I did. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero).

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nIt says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, no, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a function of \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both parts separately and then find the coefficient. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, it's \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion, which would give terms like 6c^6, 36c^4, etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the entire coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6. But that seems too extensive, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's see: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but that would be if we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me check my earlier steps. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", but since it's not specified, I'm not sure. However, given the options, I think 120 is the most reasonable answer.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), right? So the coefficient here is 6. But hold on, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the expansion of that part as well? Hmm, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part, because any other terms from the second expansion would introduce either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, which would change the variables. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the original expression has other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) times something, and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that something must be a constant term, so that when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it doesn't add any new variables. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, let's apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nWait, so the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is indeed when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20 \\times 6 a^2b^2\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct, but let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is exactly what I did. \n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. That means I might have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. Instead, perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider how it interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). However, the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in the second expression will only affect the coefficients of the terms in the first expression, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain the same as in the first expansion.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by a term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when the entire expression is considered, but \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the question is actually just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, to clarify, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the expansion. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are typically numerical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually considering the entire product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, let me check that. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) would be the constant term. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second expression is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that's not correct because each term from the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. So, that would be the term where we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nSo, to find that, we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), I get \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, each term would be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to confirm. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and then look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. As I calculated, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that might mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would result in the coefficient being a sum involving \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical value. So, that can't be right. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which gives us 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply out, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that term is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, and the question is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two separate expressions, so when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me think about how the product works. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the resulting terms would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears as \\(120a^2b^2\\) (when multiplied by the constant term 20). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nI remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are obtained by multiplying the coefficients of terms whose variables add up appropriately. In this case, I'm interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, I think the variables from the two parts are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the entire expression is a product of two separate polynomials. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a coefficient. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you just get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, if there is one.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand both parts separately, the first part will have terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part will have terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, you'd have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached to it. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by this constant term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. All other terms in the second expansion will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they'll result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is from multiplying 6 by 20, giving 120.\n\nWait a second, is that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear? Let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, any term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) will multiply this. But since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4! / (2!2!) = 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6! / (3!3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not correct because the variables are separate. Wait, no, that approach would be wrong because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part only if the second part had a term that's a constant. Wait, but actually, the second part's expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if you're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\), you need to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't stop here. I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve terms with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include terms with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a number, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which would include the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m \\times \\text{something})\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and this will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^m\\) where \\(m\\) varies. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as we found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Multiply those two coefficients together, and that will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20, but wait, no, because we have to consider that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, which includes the term 20c\u2070, so the product will have a term 6 \u00d7 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2070, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, a\u00b2b\u00b2 is only present in the first polynomial, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product will be the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial has terms with different powers of c, so when you multiply a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the second polynomial, you get a\u00b2b\u00b2c^m, where m varies. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2c^m is 6 times the coefficient of c^m in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 alone, without any c terms, is 6 times the coefficient of c^0 in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in a and b, and the other in c and 1/c. When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term a\u00b2b\u00b2 from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, and 1/c^6. So, the term a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be multiplied by 20 to give a\u00b2b\u00b2, and by the other terms to give a\u00b2b\u00b2c^m where m is not zero. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, because the 6 comes from the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the first polynomial, and 20 is the coefficient of c^0 in the second polynomial. So, when you multiply them, you get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents are:\n\n- When k=0: c^6\n- k=1: c^4\n- k=2: c^2\n- k=3: c^0\n- k=4: c^{-2}\n- k=5: c^{-4}\n- k=6: c^{-6}\n\nAnd the coefficients are:\n\n- k=0: 1\n- k=1: 6\n- k=2: 15\n- k=3: 20\n- k=4: 15\n- k=5: 6\n- k=6: 1\n\nSo, the coefficient of c^0 is indeed 20. Therefore, when I multiply this by 6 from the first polynomial, I get 120.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, I can think of it as the product of the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients would be when c=1, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which is not correct because that would be the coefficient if we were looking for a\u00b2b\u00b2 times any power of c, but we're specifically looking for a\u00b2b\u00b2 times c^0.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of c^0 in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the term a\u00b2b\u00b2 would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's not the case here because the second polynomial's terms have different powers of c, and we're only interested in the term where c^0. So, it's 6 times the coefficient of c^0 in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire expression is "

Simplifying the binomial coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the original expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), it doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Instead, I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, every term will be of the form (some combination of a and b) times (some combination of c and 1/c). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's still \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. That is, when you multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of c, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term would be the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually means considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of c, but that would still involve c. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to c. Because if you just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply the two expressions, the terms where the exponents of c cancel out (i.e., \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = c^0\\)) would contribute to the constant term in c, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, let's work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in a coefficient of 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, if we were to consider all possible terms, each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that's not the case. Actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, that would mean we're summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, regardless of the c terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in c. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in c. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nAs we calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. So, I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering c, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, regardless of c. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a number. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That suggests that when I multiply, I only care about the coefficient of the term that doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. Because if I multiply by any other term, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I only need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20 because \\(6! / (3! \\cdot 3!) = (720)/(6 \\cdot 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait a second, let me think again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, is that the final answer? Hmm, seems so.\n\nLet me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes. First, in expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, which is correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that also leads me to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nWait, but the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. That means I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well and see how it affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, maybe the coefficients from the second part will multiply the coefficients from the first part? Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by whatever coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the expansion of the second part is a power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, in other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when multiplying the two polynomials together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, their coefficients are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the right answer.

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second expansion that affects it is the constant term. So, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the constant term in the second part, which is 20, then multiplied them together to get 120. That makes sense. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. Correct. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is correct as well. So, yes, 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does not involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how it interacts with the other expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either because the second part isn't a scalar; it's an expression in terms of \\(c\\).

So, the entire product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". But in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the ways that multiplying terms from the two expansions can result in a term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and no other \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. But wait, the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is not a scalar; it's a sum of terms in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps they are treating \\(c\\) as a variable and considering the entire expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. But that seems odd because usually, when you talk about the coefficient of a term with specific variables, you're considering the other variables to be coefficients. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied in. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, each term is of the form (coefficient from first expansion) * (coefficient from second expansion) * \\(a^k b^m c^n\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(n\\) the product of the coefficients from the first and second expansions where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively. But since the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nSo, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. From the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be when \\(c = 1\\), giving 64. But if we're specifically looking for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, then it's 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible.\n\nLet me double-check. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we consider the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems less likely because the problem probably wants a specific term.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make the coefficient a single number, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me compute those coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1. So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, that's just in the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficients. \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can actually ignore the other parts because they won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, any term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) won't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, perhaps I can just take the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, but wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the second part isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHow do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that.\n\nSubstituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic because I might be making a mistake. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when we multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each of those products will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. \n\nBut actually, in the overall product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, as each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we found earlier, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression can be considered as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all independent variables, the coefficients for the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of each term in the second part is just part of the expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there another term in the first expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the second expansion? For example, if there were terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the entire coefficient will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think that's correct.\n\nLet me verify by expanding both parts separately. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), as we saw earlier. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that as well using the binomial theorem. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients here are all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The sum of the coefficients here is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply this by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), and so on. \n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in each of these products, but each time multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the way I did it is correct. The key idea is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of that specific term regardless of the other variables, we sum all the coefficients from the other expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is exactly what I calculated. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the multiplication. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are different variables, they won't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the multiplication. That is, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain separate from those of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nLet me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), this term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms involving \\(c\\) and just focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part? Or is there a misunderstanding here?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in the product will be of the form (something with a and b) multiplied by (something with c and 1/c). But since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't specify any particular power of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can write:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), solve for k:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively, that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the c terms, we need the exponent to be zero, which as we found corresponds to \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the product of these coefficients is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means I need to find all the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will only affect the \\(c\\) part, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion?\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the variables are only \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any powers of \\(c\\). But wait, that's not possible because the second part has \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which will each have some power of \\(c\\). So, unless we're considering the entire expression as a product, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), right? Or is it asking for a specific power of \\(c\\) as well? Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear on that.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). That suggests that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), and sum their coefficients. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not exactly right.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nBut wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion, but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each term in the product will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without considering \\(c\\)) is the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) is multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, in the product, each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Since Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is indeed 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part with coefficient 6, and then multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, by the sum of the coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Therefore, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\times a^3 b = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\times a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\times a b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\times 1 \\times b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Now, since \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) are multiplied together, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the part of the product where \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving only constants, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in \\(P(a, b)\\) and has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(Q(c)\\) is separate, so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we are looking for a term that also includes some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps the only way that happens is if the \\(c\\) terms in \\(Q(c)\\) multiply to 1, so that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. Let me compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\) is 20, then when we multiply \\(P(a, b)\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when we expand the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, when we multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each of these products will be \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Therefore, unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, these terms will involve \\(c\\), but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where there are no \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), as I found earlier, so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the entire expression as the product of two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because any non-constant term in \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, but since we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\), it's just the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me try another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\) factors, that corresponds to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2, and in the second polynomial, the constant term is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term where the exponent is zero, 6 - 2m = 0, so m = 3. The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\), as I found earlier. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first polynomial, and the constant term from the second polynomial is 20, so their product is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to see if the constant term is indeed 20. Let's compute each term:\n\n- m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 (1/c)^0 = 1 * c^6 * 1 = c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 (1/c)^1 = 6 * c^5 * (1/c) = 6c^4\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 (1/c)^2 = 15 * c^4 * (1/c^2) = 15c^2\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 (1/c)^3 = 20 * c^3 * (1/c^3) = 20c^0 = 20\\)\n- m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^2 (1/c)^4 = 15 * c^2 * (1/c^4) = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^1 (1/c)^5 = 6 * c * (1/c^5) = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^0 (1/c)^6 = 1 * 1 * (1/c^6) = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, yes, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, my calculation seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, does this mean that the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or are we looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)? I think it's the latter because if we consider the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, so the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120, as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, I believe the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another angle. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, these are all the terms that include \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, that's \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then consider their product.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we find \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient"

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion. So, plugging that in, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that result in a constant term (i.e., where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero). Because if there's any \\(c\\) term left, then the resulting term would involve \\(c\\) and thus not be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term we're interested in.\n\nSo, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the terms in the second part that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. All other terms involving \\(c\\) will result in terms that have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nAlright, so let's tackle the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), and solve for \\(k\\).\n\nSo, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which has a coefficient of 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term (20) in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms in the second expansion will result in terms that have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 as the constant term. When you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. The first expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\), looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Second expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the constant term. That occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the product of the two coefficients is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I might have overcomplicated it at first, but breaking it down step by step helped clarify. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term. This occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when we multiply the two expressions, each term will be a product of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the other terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we are only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will not affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're only considering the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything. But that doesn't make much sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the numerical coefficient, treating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables and ignoring other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all terms and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient from the first expression for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When you have two expressions multiplied together, like \\(P(a,b) \\cdot Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a,b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a,b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But if \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\cdot \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) will add. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can expand it using the binomial theorem as well:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 20) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical value. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but that approach would be correct if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), i.e., summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical unless specified.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider both interpretations and see which one makes sense. If I take the first approach, where we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. If I take the second approach, where we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384. But I think the first approach is more likely what the problem is asking because it's more specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, because the other part is multiplied by that term. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expression. But that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, which suggests that the coefficient is influenced by that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the exponents add, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) that result from the multiplication. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively"

So, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term, let's list the exponents of c and their coefficients:\n\n- When m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- When m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6 \\times c^4\\)\n- When m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15 \\times c^2\\)\n- When m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\times 1\\)\n- When m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15 \\times c^{-2}\\)\n- When m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6 \\times c^{-4}\\)\n- When m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1 \\times c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of the two expansions:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nBut the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, wait a second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, right? Because in the second part, we're dealing with powers of c, and there's no a or b in that part. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of \\(6a^2b^2\\) (from the first expansion) and each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut hold on, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in the first polynomial, so when I multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, each product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. So, unless the second polynomial has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is a constant term, because otherwise, the c terms would introduce variables that aren't in the original \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. So, each of these will be terms with \\(a^2b^2c^{6}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by different powers of c. So, unless the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is a constant, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by that constant term only. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, will give terms with different c powers. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the form of \\(20a^2b^2\\), because all other terms would have some power of c attached. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 20.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that. Let me consider the entire product. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second expansion gives \\(a^4c^6\\). Similarly, \\(a^4\\) multiplied by \\(6c^4\\) gives \\(6a^4c^4\\), and so on. Similarly, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once, which is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second expansion. So, that term is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. But actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of c. So, in that case, all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c would have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of them, but the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term would have a different power of c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless multiplied by a constant. So, actually, the only term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of c. But wait, in that case, the term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion would result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms would have c powers attached, so they wouldn't be pure \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, unless the problem is considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c, but I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c's exponent. But that's not possible because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is always multiplied by some power of c. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can exist without c is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the term would be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let's take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there are no terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) because the highest power of a and b in the first expansion is 2 and 2, but when multiplied by the second expansion, which is degree 1 in c, but no a or b terms. Wait, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by a constant term in the second expansion. But in this case, the second expansion doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent is zero, which would require c^0, but in this case, the second expansion is only degree 1, so it doesn't have a constant term. So, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the second expansion does have a constant term, which is 20. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 120. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponent, then it's a bit ambiguous because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various c terms. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, and the exponent of c is also zero. So, that would be the term \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all terms where a is squared and b is squared, regardless of c's exponent. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in c=1, which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply by each term, the coefficients add up differently. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of c would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c's exponent, which is not standard. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term, it's in the entire expression, considering all variables. So, if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then the coefficient would be 384. But that seems unlikely because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's spread across different c exponents. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist as part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, there is no term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is standalone without any c terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero because there's no such term. But that can't be right because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no c terms. So, that term exists, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but in the product, the term \\(120a^2b^2\\) is present, so the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of it another way. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 120, because that's the only term where a and b are squared without any c terms. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\n\nIn this case, there is no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), because the second expansion only has c and 1/c, no constants. So"

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me set up the equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), which would mean that \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have to consider the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part of the product. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the value of \\(c\\) terms doesn't matter because we're just looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it because we're only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me double-check. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part, I would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, right? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) term, that would change the variables, so it wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, maybe I need to find the term in the second part that is a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part.\n\nOkay, so let's try that. First, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. That means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term from the second part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, which is 20, as I found earlier. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but another way to check is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as we calculated. Then, since the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term of 20, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just go through it again quickly. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term in this part is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, I need to consider the entire product. Now, when you multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on that specific term in the first part and see how it interacts with the second part.\n\nIn other words, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, the variables won't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in that expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, effectively scaling its coefficient by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, it doesn't affect the variables, but the coefficients do add up. So, yes, I think this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficients just get scaled by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where the product of the terms from each polynomial gives \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems high, but I think it's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: if I expand both parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from all possible products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term. Since the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when considering just the coefficient, without considering the variables, it's the coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing coefficients with terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling its coefficient. So, yes, 6 times 64 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider specific terms. Let's see, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each such term will be \\(6\\) times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if the second expansion has a constant term. Because if it does, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the middle term. Let me calculate that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, if I only consider the constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{something}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. However, the entire product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the only term that would have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b \\right) \\times \\left( \\text{terms involving } c \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen you multiply these out, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second factor is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), no, wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) terms are not considered. Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that exists in the product only if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term attached. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would have a different term, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to this.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so why is the constant term 20? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of coefficients as 64, but the constant term is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplying it by each term in the second expansion gives:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 15c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 20\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 20 = "

So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nOkay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), right? So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider that as well. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nI think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. But wait, since the two expressions are multiplied together, and they involve different variables, maybe the coefficients don't interfere with each other? Let me think. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), only has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it? Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, but we're only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. But that seems off because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because if you think of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, then it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with a coefficient. But if the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's like treating \\(c\\) as 1, so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider how that term interacts with the other expression.\n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, the variables multiply as well. So, actually, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, no, because when you multiply, the variables from both expressions combine. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would actually be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times the term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are exactly 2 each, but the powers of \\(c\\) can be anything. Wait, no, actually, no, because when you multiply, the variables multiply, so \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only appear if the second term is 1, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-6 + m}\\) or something? Wait, no, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times their own terms. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the variables would carry over.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the variables. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times the term from the second expansion. So, for example, if the second expansion has a term \\(c^3\\), then \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^3\\) is a term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only be the coefficient from the first expansion if the second term is 1, but that's not the case here. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That might make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve finding the terms where in the first expansion, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, we have \\(c^k \\times c^{-k}\\), which is \\(c^0\\). So, in the second expansion, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's think about that.\n\nSo, first, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, it will give me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term.\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 (from the first) times 20 (from the second), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way this could happen? For example, could there be other terms in the first expansion that when multiplied by terms in the second expansion result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Wait, no, because in the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other term would have different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, they would contribute to different terms. So, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (from the constant term) would be \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, no, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 20, so the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm being too hasty. Let me consider the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, expanding both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the resulting terms will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), as I found earlier.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by \\(c^k\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nIf that's the case, then my earlier reasoning is correct: the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term irrespective of \\(c\\), then that would be different. But in reality, in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) powers and \\(c\\) powers. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist if the \\(c\\) part is 1, which is the constant term. So, I think the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to come from the first expansion, and the second expansion would have to contribute a term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but only \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first expansion, but multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only be present if \\(c^k\\) is 1, which is only when \\(k=0\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second factor contributes 1, which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a separate entity, then that would be different. But in the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it usually refers to the term with exactly those variables and exponents, so \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in this case.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check my understanding again. Let me think: if I have two polynomials, say, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I multiply them together, the result is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, you get terms that are products of monomials from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), meaning each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(m\\) is some exponent.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist in the product if \\(m = 0\\), because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is what I calculated as 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any other term in the first expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term in the second expansion? For example, if I have \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion, and I multiply it by \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second expansion, would that give me \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which is a different term, so it wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, other terms would have different exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so they wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k"

Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I should expand this as well, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and then multiply it by the entire second expansion? Or do I need to consider cross terms? Wait, no, because the variables in the second part are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the variables are separate. That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since they are different variables, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That seems confusing because the second part has \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, so it's possible that the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it would have coefficients multiplied by some powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be in \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, let me check the problem again.\n\nIt says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed by expanding both expressions and then look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), which isn't typical in such problems. So, perhaps the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). From the expansion I did earlier, that's 6.\n\nNow, the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720/(6\u00d76) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion? Yes, because any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. Maybe I should write out the entire expansion, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let me think differently: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The only term that will result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is when it's multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem specifies \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a scalar, not a polynomial. So, I think my initial assumption is correct, that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms and just took the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied it by the entire second expansion. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number, so that can't be right. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering the combined variables, so \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which gives 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second. So, their product gives \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients to get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't mention \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual because coefficients are typically constants. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something else where all variables are combined, but given the problem as stated, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to a specific term, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. The powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\); they just multiply along with it. So, I can treat the \\(c\\) terms as coefficients when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me clarify that. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nHold on, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like c\u2076, 6c\u2074, 15c\u00b2, 20, 15c\u207b\u00b2, 6c\u207b\u2074, c\u207b\u2076, each of these will result in terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2076, 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2074, 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2, 120a\u00b2b\u00b2, 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u207b\u00b2, 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u207b\u2074, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u207b\u2076. So, each of these terms will have a factor of a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by different powers of c. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, regardless of the power of c. Wait, but that can't be right because the term a\u00b2b\u00b2 is present in the product, but it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the only term that contributes to a\u00b2b\u00b2 without any c terms is when we multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20. All other terms will have a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by some power of c, so they won't just be a\u00b2b\u00b2; they'll have extra factors of c or 1/c.\n\nWait, so actually, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120, because only when we multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20 (the constant term) do we get a term that is just a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by 20. All other terms will have additional c factors, so they won't contribute to the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term alone. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nWhen I multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of c. The only term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c factors is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nBut wait, is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. But none of the other terms in the first polynomial, like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(4ab^3\\), or \\(b^4\\), when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, would result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, \\(a^4\\) multiplied by any term would give \\(a^4c^k\\), which doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(4a^3b\\) multiplied by any term would give \\(4a^3bc^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). The same goes for the other terms. So, only the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, when multiplied by the constant term 20, gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait a second, but is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire product and using the concept of multinomial coefficients or something else? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables (one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\)), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with any term from the second polynomial, but only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. Therefore, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other contributions. Suppose I think about the entire expansion, is there any other combination where \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from? For example, could terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) other than \\(a^2b^2\\) combine with terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) in such a way that the variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the variables don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with a constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two polynomials are in different variables, the coefficients multiply independently. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial has a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\), the result is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(k = 0\\), it's \\(c^6\\); \\(k = 1\\), \\(c^{4}\\); \\(k = 2\\), \\(c^{2}\\); \\(k = 3\\), \\(c^{0} = 1\\); \\(k = 4\\), \\(c^{-2}\\); \\(k = 5\\), \\(c^{-4}\\); \\(k = 6\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the expansion is correct, and the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both expansions.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients, we get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe terms are:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nThe constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) is 20.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me expand that.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the question is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so does that mean I can treat the coefficients separately? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and it doesn't matter what the other part is because it's multiplied by something else, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the terms would contribute other variables, so the coefficient remains 6. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result would be a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms involving \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by some coefficient from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because every term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from that part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and we want the sum of the coefficients of those terms, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the terms involving different variables don't interfere. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because every term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me check this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 0 because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. Wait, no, because the second part only has terms up to \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2\\), you get \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in this case, the second part doesn't have \\(b\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear. Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have 6 * 6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would have 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) (with no \\(c\\)) would have 6 * 20 = 120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) would have 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) would have 6 * 6 = 36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would have 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all these coefficients. So, adding them up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 6 + 36 = 42. Then, 42 + 90 = 132. Then, 132 + 120 = 252. Next, 252 + 90 = 342. Then, 342 + 36 = 378. Finally, 378 + 6 = 384. So, the total coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so multiplying by 6 gives 384. That seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but in the example I thought of earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first part by \\(b^2\\), but in the second part, there are no \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, in that example, the second part is only in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(ab c\\), \\(ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear at all because there's no \\(b\\) in the second part. So, the coefficient would be zero. But in the original problem, the second part is in \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but in the example, the second part is in \\(c\\), so the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^1 = 2\\). So, if the first part had a term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 1 (if it were present) times 2, so 2. But in reality, in the example, the first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because that term doesn't exist. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. In the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, which is in \\(c\\), it just adds different powers of \\(c\\) to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the coefficient is just 6, but that seems incorrect because the product would involve multiple terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had been \\((a + b + c)^4\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve combinations where \\(c\\) is also present, but in this case, the second part is separate, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part. So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the product is a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has a coefficient of 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) has 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 3"

The formula for combinations is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So plugging in 4 and 2, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but hold on, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part, so when I multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, right?\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient very large, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, which doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me check again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both parts. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the answer should be 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, is just 6, because each multiplication by the second expansion's terms doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\); it just adds more terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of that term. So, for example, if the second expansion has a term \\(k c^m\\), then \\(6a^2b^2 \\times k c^m = 6k a^2b^2 c^m\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^m\\) is 6k. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because when you consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first expansion. Therefore, when you multiply by the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't change. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms, so when you multiply, you're effectively distributing the \\(a^2b^2\\) term across all the terms in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nBut I'm confused because I thought that when you multiply by the second expansion, the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. But now I'm thinking that's not the case because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is just 6.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm getting 384. Let me check which one is correct. The key is to understand what the problem is asking. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so in that case, the coefficient is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nI think I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's considering all possible terms, including those multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients that come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), those coefficients add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and all those contributions add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this manually. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, my earlier approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my earlier logic, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, my approach was wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, the correct approach must be that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which is different from 1 * 2 = 2. Therefore, my earlier logic was incorrect. So, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't contribute to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier thought where I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you multiply these two,"

Now, but wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), interacts with the first part. \n\nSince the entire expression is a product of two expansions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term's coefficient will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by any term in the second expansion, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we might need to sum over all possible terms in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term multiplied by it will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible coefficients from the second expansion and add them up? Or is there another way?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be obtained by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you won't get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. \n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again for this. \n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms will have powers of \\(c\\), which won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, does that mean I need to consider that when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, hold on. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression also involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient might involve terms from the other expansion as well? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

However, since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, their exponents won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part? But that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a separate expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me break it down. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply out the entire expression, we're looking for all the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and then sum their coefficients. But the problem is, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute various terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms just act as coefficients for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in other words, when you multiply everything out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. The second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.

So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe each term in the expansion of the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient without considering \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient from the second expansion. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply out, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which suggests it's a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they interact.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, that gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), so term is \\(1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), so term is \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), so term is \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so term is \\(20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), so term is \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), so term is \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), so term is \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient and the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me confirm that. Alternatively, if we consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, and then summed over all terms in the second expansion. But that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get different terms in the product, each with their own coefficients. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're supposed to consider that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the second part is part of the product, so it would contribute to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it this way: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to make sure. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which is \\(a^2\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's verify by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The \\(a^2\\) term would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But if we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. So, in that case, the method works.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Let me try expanding that.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts of the expression. I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the constant term, or maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. \n\nBut in this case, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, is that right? Because if I take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think my initial thought was correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the terms involving \\(c\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion because each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term from the first expansion. So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so that gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me check if that's correct by another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should expand both parts and see how the coefficients combine. Let me try that. First, as I did before, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms in the second expansion are:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated before, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check by actually expanding a small part. Let's take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by each term in the second expansion:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) are all these, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) stands alone without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that's a different approach. So, maybe I was wrong before. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or is it looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all specified? Hmm, the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be different. For example, if it were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), because the only term in the second expansion with \\(c^0\\) is 20. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when people ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they might mean the coefficient when all other variables are set to zero or something. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial.\n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me just check another way. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part can be any term from its expansion. So, when you multiply, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nSo, sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 times 64, which is 384. That makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), all the \\(c\\) terms become 1, so the entire expression is just 64 times \\((a + b)^4\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead considered the general case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so again, 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part (since we're considering all possible terms) is the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think I've checked this in multiple ways, and each time I get 384. So, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe expansion is:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).
