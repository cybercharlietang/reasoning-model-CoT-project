I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial only multiplies the constant term in the second polynomial because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term we're looking for. That makes sense because we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any other term from the second polynomial would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term's exponent. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only looking for the product of the coefficients where the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second polynomial sum to zero. But in this case, since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get \\(c^0\\) is by choosing three \\(c\\) terms and three \\(1/c\\) terms, which gives us the \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) coefficient, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm confident that the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term in the second part. Since the second part's constant term is 20, and the first part's coefficient is 6, multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. There are no other combinations because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

So, the first part was straightforward: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.

That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake there. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that their variables don't interfere. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.
