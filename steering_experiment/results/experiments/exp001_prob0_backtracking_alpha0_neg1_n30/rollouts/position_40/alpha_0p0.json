So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (c^0) has a coefficient of 20. Since when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term in the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second polynomial, you'd end up with a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero, which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second polynomial contributes a \\(c^0\\) term will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of any term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion. Since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that again gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've checked this enough times. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I considered that to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term from the other polynomial. That makes sense because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term we're looking for. The coefficients I found for each part seem correct: 6 and 20.
