    "text": " However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and 1 from the second part, plus the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and each term from the second expansion. But no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^0\\) and then up to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and correctly identified the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and correctly found that the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from that part is 6, as I found earlier, and then we need to consider how it's multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just 6? But that seems too simple. Wait, no, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so we need to consider the product of both expansions. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product. When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that any term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) only if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me verify this. So, the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), and the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply these, we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the exponents add up appropriately. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and we're looking for the same term regardless of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) doesn't appear in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients is 64, but that would give 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which contradicts the 120 I found earlier. So, where is the mistake? Wait, no, actually, the sum of coefficients is when you set all variables to 1, which would include all terms, but in this case, we're only interested in the constant term because we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply that by 6, giving 120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^3b \\times c^5\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents along with \\(c\\) exponents. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a constant. So, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would still involve \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're to sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would be a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, if I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, then each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + ... + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire expansion, there are multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? That is, summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents? If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that interpretation. If that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part has a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a different interpretation, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Given that the problem specifies \\(a^2b^2\\) without mentioning \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Therefore, the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal, which happens when we choose 3 of each. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. Specifically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient is a number, but when you multiply by different powers of \\(c\\), they become different terms. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem as stated just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more complicated.

That is, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from all possible \\(c\\) terms that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). But that might not make sense because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But I think the more likely scenario is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the total coefficient will be 6 times that. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20, so when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the \\(c^0\\) term, which has coefficient 20. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps I should interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That seems more plausible. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other polynomial involves \\(c\\), maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a number, so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but only focusing on \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a function of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) appears. That must be it. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. So, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already started. As before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut we're interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I think it's considering \\(c^0\\) implicitly. So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me verify that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(20\\) from the second part, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(20c^0\\), that gives \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a single expansion and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) appears. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.

Wait, but that's not right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by 6, you'd have 6 times each of those coefficients, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, each multiplied by 6.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not specified. The problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that we're looking for the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean that in addition to \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That makes more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, for the second part, I needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent is zero, leading to \\(k = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, in the overall product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, it just adds a factor involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient remains the same.

So, perhaps the way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its own coefficient to the product. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. But in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the product. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I might be misapplying the concept. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as a product of two separate expansions. So, when I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, when considering coefficients, is just the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to ensure that the sum of its coefficients is 64. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to realize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms that combine to form that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a sum of terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I think of it as a product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, does that mean we're considering the entire expansion and looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or are we supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part and then multiply them? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, which suggests a numerical value. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem didn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and that's it, since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so probably it's expecting a product of the coefficients. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be a large expression, and multiplying by 6 would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and that's it, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have coefficients that sum up to \\(2^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is just asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, the term will be multiplied by \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so probably it's expecting a product. Wait, but when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion will be multiplied by the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second polynomial, you get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other polynomial, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

So, yes, that would be 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) indeed 20? Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again: 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, the corresponding term in the second polynomial must be the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me check each step again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.

So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think of the entire product, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore all the \\(c\\) terms except the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent to zero, we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) to find \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because if I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left(\\text{something}\\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by 1 from the second part, but that's not possible because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get the product of two expansions. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second expansion has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), etc. But when you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) times \\(c^6\\) would give \\(a^4c^6\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would include terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the second part contributes a term that is 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). But in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, let's think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the term in the second expansion that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) has a coefficient of 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That is, 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120.

But in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), all the terms have \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, we'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\) because they'll all have some \\(c\\) term. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that such a term exists. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be zero because every term in the product would have some power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then separately consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but I don't think that's the case because the problem specifies the entire product. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. That makes sense. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

Because if I take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we only want the term without any \\(c\\), so that's the constant term. So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first will multiply each term of the second, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we just need to find the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum over all possible pairs of terms from each polynomial that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the first polynomial has terms only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms only in \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\).

So, that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't just a single number, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second polynomial as a constant.

Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which would include the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a single coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is presented as asking for a single coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only be possible if the \\(c\\) terms somehow cancel out, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That is, the constant term in the second expansion. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems more plausible because it gives a single numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, effectively making the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't what the problem is asking for. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But that seems a bit off because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall coefficient when considering the entire expression. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's indeed 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would give 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply, each term in the second expression would contribute to the coefficient. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and the coefficients are binomial coefficients. As we found, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms that are products of each term from the first expansion and each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me verify this by another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each term in the product being \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check if I didn't make a mistake in assuming that the sum of coefficients is 64. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so that's correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's right. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

That would be a specific term. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. So, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because the \\(c\\) terms would have to cancel out to get \\(c^0\\).

So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Then, I correctly identified that to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I also need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which comes from the middle term of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Calculating that coefficient as 20, which is correct. Multiplying them together gives 120, which seems right.

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part, that term would have a \\(c\\) component, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that must mean we're looking for the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just carry over the coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have a term with \\(c^k\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), unless \\(k = 0\\), the term will have \\(c\\) in it. So, to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.

But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but only focusing on \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't quite make sense because the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms as well. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve considering the product with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a polynomial in \\(c\\).

However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm supposed to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply by 6. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which might imply that we are to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all the terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem didn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we are to sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me verify this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest of the expression is just a multiplier, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I need to interpret the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was correct initially that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all the terms from the second expansion, but that's not possible because the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms only in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. But that would mean setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did earlier, giving 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. That would make sense, as then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. Let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), then the answer is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a polynomial in \\(c\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, given that the problem didn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the intended answer is 120, assuming that we're to consider the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems plausible. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a sum over all the terms in the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems too broad.

But then, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in the expansion has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, but when you sum them all, it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a different power of \\(c\\).

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second.

But if we are to write the entire product, it would be a sum of terms, each being a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is misinterpreted.

Wait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when you expand the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term from the second expansion. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be in multiple variables, and it's acceptable for the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe that's not what it's asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion is irrelevant because it's in terms of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem includes both expansions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion is irrelevant because it's multiplied by the entire term. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it stands, I have to work with what's given. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Given that the problem didn't specify, but considering that in such problems, sometimes they ask for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because if you take any other term from the \\(c\\) expansion, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) for \\(m\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20, so when you multiply, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in the other expansion. So, I don't need to consider any other terms from the \\(c\\) part because they would introduce factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). The constant term is 20, as I found. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 * 20 = 120, and that's the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term from the \\(c\\) expansion would add a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by 6, each would contribute separately. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is a product of two independent expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we expand the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the \\(c\\) expansion.

So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct? Wait, let me check that again. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so when you multiply them, you get 6*64=384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6*64=384. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second polynomial, so probably the coefficient is multiplied by that. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a product, and considering all possible terms. But I think the key here is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, let me compute that. Let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of the coefficients in the second part really 64? Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied entirely, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that implies that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that. First, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.

So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is still \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. However, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but since it's not specified, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not right either. Wait, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, as I thought before. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I should consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times 6, which is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's the term where the second factor contributes \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, that doesn't sound right because the problem is probably treating the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right either because the coefficients in the second part are not just numbers; they also depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up to 64, so when you multiply by 6, it's 6*64. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have coefficients multiplied by each other. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so each term in the second part is a separate term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. The entire expression is then multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
