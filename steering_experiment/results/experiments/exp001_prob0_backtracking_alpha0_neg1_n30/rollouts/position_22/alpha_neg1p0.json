    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), where \\(k + m = 4\\) and \\(n\\) is determined by the \\(c\\) expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64? That would be 384. But that seems high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a simpler answer. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each \\(m\\) contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we sum over all \\(m\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me verify this. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, given the way the problem is phrased, it's likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes problems like this ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables, but in this case, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct to consider all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply them, the terms would be products of terms from each expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where, when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by some term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part would combine to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which is what we're looking for. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, the only term that contributes is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, because any other term from the second part would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would mean the product term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the only contribution comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just write that down.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms affect this. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the \\(c\\) terms in the second expansion multiply to give a constant term. Because any other term would have a \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the overall term have a \\(c\\) component. So, to get a term without \\(c\\), I need the product of the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to result in a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can also be done using the binomial theorem.

But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient itself is a combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just a numerical coefficient. That makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply those two coefficients together. That sounds plausible. Let me check that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer.

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the term from the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero for the constant term, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(20\\), so when you multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything. The key was realizing that to get a term without any \\(c\\) (i.e., a constant term in terms of \\(c\\)), the exponent on \\(c\\) must be zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\) in the binomial expansion. So, the constant term is 20, and then multiplying by the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gives 120. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be the case if we were considering the entire expansion, but actually, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c\\) raised to some power, and when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me see if that makes sense. Another way: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^2b^0 would be C(2,0) = 1, and the coefficient of a^1b^1 is C(2,1) = 2, and a^0b^2 is 1. Then, the entire expression would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) * (c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 0, because there's no a^2b^2 term. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so in that case, the coefficient is zero. But in the original problem, the second polynomial is (c + 1/c)^6, which when expanded, has terms like c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6. So, when multiplied by (a + b)^4, the terms are products of a and b terms with c terms. But since we're only looking for a^2b^2, which is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes terms in c, which don't affect a and b. So, in the product, a^2b^2 is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 (from a^2b^2 in the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, it's the product of the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is (c + 1/c)^6, the sum of its coefficients is found by setting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. If you multiply by any other term, like \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the product would have a term involving \\(c^k\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion.

So, let me break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have that, multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, so let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).

    "text": " But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that seems a bit odd because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would mean that when you multiply out the two expressions, you're looking for all terms that are of the form \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. But that seems a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't quite make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, and the \\(c\\) part is separate. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times c^k\\) or \\(6 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, no, the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems like a possible answer, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, let me find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120. Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the entire expression's coefficient, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120. That seems plausible. Let me think again: If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 120, as that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we also consider the \\(c\\) terms and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That might make more sense. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion and find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, that's also correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and \\(c^0\\) is in the second part, their product will indeed be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus the product would have terms involving \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, maybe the part with \\(c\\) just contributes a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be a specific value, but I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) is a separate part, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is another part, when you multiply them together, the terms will be products of terms from each. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem just asks for the coefficient. Maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the expansion. So, if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, implying that perhaps we're supposed to consider the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1 or something. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without considering \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That sounds more reasonable. So, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). But now, by considering \\(c^0\\), I got 120. Alternatively, if I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms, and just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would be 6 times the expansion, which would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd unless the problem is expecting a polynomial. However, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is possible. However, the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be a number, implying that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, which would imply that we're looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, then perhaps it's implicitly asking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved, which is 120. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, that might make sense. Let me think about it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product is a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those coefficients because each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if we consider the entire product, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because usually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. Wait, no, that's when you're multiplying two polynomials in the same variables. In this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is in variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the resulting polynomial has terms that are products of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, meaning the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term of the expansion. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The constant term is when the exponents cancel out, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Because otherwise, if it's considering all terms, the coefficient would be 384, but that seems too large. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because each term contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

But maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to clarify this. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from each part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is about a single term, \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is 6 * 20 = 120. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial would contribute all its terms. But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever terms are in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not possible because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because usually, the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since the variables are separate, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the entire second polynomial, which is 1 * (c + 1/c). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Let me confirm this approach. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term that is constant in \\(c\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in that expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in that expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without considering the sum, I could note that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) vary, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all terms from the product, but that would involve considering the product of the two expansions. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as the product of two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms from the first polynomial are multiplied by the terms from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which expands to terms like \\(c^6, 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is irrelevant to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient would indeed be multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify this approach. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would mean I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. However, given that the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is involved. So, let me proceed with that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Let me double-check this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these, you get 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\).

So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check this reasoning because sometimes when dealing with products, you have to consider that each term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply the 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients or the sum. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64. 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would only come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, their coefficients don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are in different variables. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, actually, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the coefficient from each part of the product. \n\n1.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Because if you have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you collect all the terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making the term independent of \\(c\\)? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that each term in the product will have a part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a part from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because otherwise, the problem is a bit ambiguous. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to do that, I need to consider the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's different from 384. So, now I'm confused because the problem didn't specify whether it's looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, the terms will have factors of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but usually, when variables are given without exponents, it's implied that you consider the term where those variables have their exponents and others are zero. So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me think again. If the problem had just \\((a + b)^4\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But since it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. But that's not the case because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all the terms in the \\(c\\) expansion, each contributing their coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be more precise. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, because the exponents go from 6 to -6 in steps of -2. Wait, no, let me think again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which would be 64, so 6*64=384. But now, if I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. So, which is it? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which seems unlikely. So, assuming that, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But that seems high. Let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 6*20=120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply out, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, let me confirm that. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought that if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But now I'm confused because the problem statement isn't entirely clear. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, after all that, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But since the question is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}^m\\), but to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), you need \\(k = m\\), so that \\(c^k \\cdot c^{-m} = c^{k - m}\\) and for this to be a constant, \\(k - m = 0\\), so \\(k = m\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal. So, let's find that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0 to get a constant term. So, solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the second part must contribute a constant term, which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each of these terms is the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so effectively, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify. If we have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because for each term in \\(Q(c)\\), say \\(q_k c^k\\), when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 q_k c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\((\\text{coefficient of }a^2b^2 \\text{ in } P) \\times (\\text{coefficient of }c^k \\text{ in } Q)\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to consider all possible \\(c^k\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, first, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do we do that? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), and the first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply this by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, and the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might not be correct either because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But that seems a bit off because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me check that logic. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then for \\(c\\), we need the exponent to be 0, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and in the second part, we need the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is symmetric, so the middle term is indeed when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 3} \\times c^{-3} = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I didn't think about the exponents, I might have considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the entire second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that would give 6 times 64, which is 384, which is way too big, so that approach is wrong. So, the correct approach is to consider that only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) exponent, making it a different term altogether. So, the correct coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) (which doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that can't be right because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in reality, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems too high. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe the correct answer is 384. But wait, let me double-check. Let me think about how the multiplication works. The first polynomial has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second polynomial has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. When you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, let me check that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, then multiply them together. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient we're looking for is 6 times \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but I think I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part doesn't just get multiplied by the sum of coefficients of the other part. Instead, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if the term from the second polynomial is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because then when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant, you still get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). If the term from the second polynomial has \\(c\\) raised to some power, then when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which is not what we want. So, actually, we only need the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute both parts. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all the terms from the second part, but only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms from the second polynomial will introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product will have both the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might make sense because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it doesn't specify. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is whatever. But that doesn't make much sense because the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when the powers of \\(c\\) cancel each other. So, that would involve finding the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems reasonable. Let me just double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 * c^0 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term, and just multiplied the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that would be if we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the resulting terms would be 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, ..., down to 6a^2b^2c^{-6}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I need to clarify. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so maybe it's considering the coefficient in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials with different variables, it's referring to the term where the variables match exactly. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 120, as calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not typical. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. Let me see if that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term in the first part, its coefficient in the overall product will be the same as its coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficient in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, if \\(Q(c)\\) has terms like \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\), each with their own coefficients, then when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear as a term if there's a term in \\(Q(c)\\) that is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. When you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). There are no other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because they involve different combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. Since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the part of the second polynomial that contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, by finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiplying it by the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, we get 120. That seems correct. Let me double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. 6 * 20 is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{120}"
