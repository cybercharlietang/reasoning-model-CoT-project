So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the binomial coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\) is also correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, except through their constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
