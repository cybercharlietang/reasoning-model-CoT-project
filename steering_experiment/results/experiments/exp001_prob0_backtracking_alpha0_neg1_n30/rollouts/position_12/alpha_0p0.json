    "text": " Okay, so the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the entire expansion of that as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes me think that maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is a separate expression, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when we multiply it by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check: if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear as a standalone term if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because otherwise, if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Let me double-check by considering the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as we found earlier has terms up to \\(c^6\\) and \\(1/c^6\\), with the middle term being 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get 120a^2b^2. All other terms from the second expansion would introduce powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, that part is clear; the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if this part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. That means when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means the entire second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. When I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there a possibility that the second part affects the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? No, because the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait another thought: Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if there's any cross terms, but I don't think so because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me see: If I expand the entire product, each term would be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6 in steps determined by the exponents in the second part. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that requires \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that term is 20, and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, gives 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1.

Wait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of the second part is? Or do I need to consider something else? Wait, no, I think I might be overcomplicating it.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.

So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.

Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. If I have two separate expressions multiplied together, and I'm looking for the coefficient of a term that only involves variables from the first expression, then the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and not the entire term, maybe we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients get multiplied as well. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is a term in \\(P\\), and when multiplied by \\(Q\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But since \\(Q\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c\\) term would contribute to different terms in the product. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(Q\\) has a different power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that seems unlikely because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it would only appear once in the product, multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the constant term in \\(Q\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(Q\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is 6 (from \\(P\\)) times 20 (from \\(Q\\)), which is 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, earlier I thought the coefficient was just 6, but that's only if I'm considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(Q\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this again. So, in \\(P = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but only the constant term in \\(Q\\) will result in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term in \\(Q\\) would have a \\(c\\) power, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I was confused earlier because I thought maybe the \\(c\\) terms didn't matter, but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term, we have to consider how it's affected by the multiplication with \\(Q\\). So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, I think I need to consider the entire expansion because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of both expressions. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will create a new term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, when you expand the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible terms from the second part. But that doesn't quite make sense because each multiplication would add a term with \\(c\\) to it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all possible terms and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you have to consider all variables. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see if that makes sense. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That sounds more accurate. So, let me break it down into two parts: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). 2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Okay, let's tackle the first part again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, I multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering \\(c^0\\)) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), multiplying by the second part won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it just scales the coefficient. So, I think that's the case here. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way it can come from the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion with the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a constant term of 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I see! So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, no, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just in the first part, so its coefficient is 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6, and the rest is multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is not present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would still be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a possible answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficient gets multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But I think that's not the case because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\), then when you multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then you're considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, you would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are variables, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and find the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is not present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply by the second part, the coefficient should be scaled by the entire expansion. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the polynomial, perhaps it's just 6 times the second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's in terms of \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic, and I feel like I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in \\(c\\). When you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a more involved answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, so its coefficient is 6, and the second part is just another factor, but since we're only asked about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6. But I'm not sure. Wait, let me think about how coefficients work when multiplying polynomials. If you have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when you multiply them, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * Q(c). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) is not present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's the correct approach.

    "text": " So, that part is clear; the coefficient is 6. Now, the problem is that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire term is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so does that mean that I need to consider the entire expansion, or just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\)? Let me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately from the rest. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is... well, what power? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated because there would be multiple terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the expansion as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me consider that when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, I think that's probably what the problem is asking. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me approach it that way. So, first, I'll expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as I found before. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion would multiply each term in the first expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify. Hmm, maybe I should proceed differently.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, which is 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem was written incorrectly, or I misread it. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that's not correct because the second part is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to proceed step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is 6, and it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the terms from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, from the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. From the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's find that term.\n\nUsing the binomial expansion for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I wrote before. We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each expansion. So, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. \n\n1.

So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the terms in the second expression have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the entire second expression. But actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but that's not accurate. The sum of all coefficients in the second expression is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients, which is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second expression is multiplied by each term, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expression's expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I have to consider whether those terms affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6 multiplied by whatever the entire second part evaluates to, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is a separate variable, perhaps the coefficient remains 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the second part is a separate term, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only one term in the product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all terms that don't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the entire expansion would include all terms, which would make the coefficient very large. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the product will have terms where each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, that can't be, because the second polynomial is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-n}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second polynomial contributes a term that is 1, because \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would give me the constant term, which is the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, I need to compute two things: 1) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and 2) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), but that's not what we want. We only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2.

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). That means I only need to consider the part of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. In other words, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, since the terms are multiplied together. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.

    "text": " So, that part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire expression as the product of two binomial expansions. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Let me think. Since the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, the terms from each expansion will multiply together. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply with each term from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that any terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) are irrelevant for this specific coefficient. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of it. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which will have multiple terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms will not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we need to consider the corresponding \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, we might need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values, but actually, no, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. So, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's possible that the term could have any power of \\(c\\), but I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that might not make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it might mean the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, which would give a coefficient of 6 * 64. But that seems a bit strange because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in each of those products. So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it might be implying that it's looking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in the expansion, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, to get a term with exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part must be \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would involve finding the term where in the first expansion, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, we have \\(c^0\\). So, as I thought earlier, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer could be 384 if considering all \\(c\\) terms. But now I'm convinced that the problem is asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so the answer is 120. Let me double-check this. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, we also want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, that makes sense.

    "text": " So, that part is clear; the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but the entire expression is a product of these two parts. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that way when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, let me figure out what term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has \\(c^0\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's a separate variable. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the entire expanded expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\)? Or are we looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is actually an expression involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when they ask for the coefficient, they mean the numerical coefficient, treating other variables as constants. Wait, but in this case, maybe it's different because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might not be correct either. Let me think differently. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\), but that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't 64. Wait, actually, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, let's try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would be the constant term. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating by considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I need to consider that when multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficient as the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-n})\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present as a standalone term, it's only present multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. But that's not what the problem states. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to re-express the problem. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which include \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients is 64, but the coefficient of each specific term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) varies. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because the expansion is symmetric. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will have a coefficient, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a specific number. So, assuming that, let me proceed. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to consider the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient has to be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), and summing their coefficients. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a specific number. So, under that assumption, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, so I think the former interpretation is correct.

Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever part of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is being multiplied by 1 (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) must be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will be the one that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term that's just a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply this by the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which had a coefficient of 6, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there a possibility that I'm supposed to consider cross terms or something else? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes a constant factor when considering the term without \\(c\\). So, I think I'm correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's the product of two polynomials. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single coefficient. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I misinterpret the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, each of those coefficients gets multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, I need to consider both expansions: the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives me the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\) as well. But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering all possible exponents of the other variables. Wait, but in this case, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the terms from the product. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we have to consider the product as a single expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve multiplying the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the first interpretation is correct. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6*64=384. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the other part is also a polynomial, so when you multiply, the coefficient would be scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the other polynomial. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and in the other polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the other polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms. However, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. Because each term in the other polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. But let's expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a^1b^0\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient is 1*c + 1*(1/c). Wait, but that's not a constant coefficient; it's a coefficient that depends on \\(c\\). Hmm, this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect. Let me think again. When you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that's not quite right because the second polynomial is not a constant. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but in my simple example, that approach gave me 2, but when I expanded, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps that approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. But in the simple example, that approach would give me 1*2=2, but the actual coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second. So, let's try that approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6*20=120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. However, in the simple example, that approach didn't work because it gave a constant coefficient when the actual coefficient was a term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is not a constant. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. But let me check that with the simple example. If I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so 2. But when I expand, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not 2. So, that approach is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out would contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in"

    "text": " Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Wait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, including all terms from both parts. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that might not be correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will create a new term in the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the original problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when multiplied by the second part, it would create multiple terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by 1 (the constant term in the second expansion), you just get the same term. But wait, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. So when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20 \\times 6 = 120\\), so the coefficient is 120. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be affected by the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which is a different term. So, I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present when \\(k = 0\\), i.e., when multiplied by the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, in the original expression, it's a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part.

Let me try to break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, but let's proceed with the assumption that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by every term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that sum is indeed 64, as I thought before, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let's explore that possibility. \n\nSo, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the overall coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure if the problem specifies the \\(c\\) term or not. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, as I thought earlier, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the user is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but when you're considering the coefficient of a specific term in the product, you have to consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. When I multiply them, P(a, b) * Q(c) = (a + b)^4 * (c + 1/c)^6. So, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the entire Q. So, when considering the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in Q, so the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q). Since the sum of coefficients in Q is when c=1, which is (1 + 1)^6 = 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, that seems correct, but I'm not sure if the problem is expecting that. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It says \"in\" the product, but it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of Q, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not clear. Let me see if I can find a source or example where such a problem is given. Wait, perhaps I can think of it differently. If I consider the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}c^{-n}\\), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first polynomial, and any term in the second polynomial, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but to confirm, let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, since when c=1, the sum of coefficients is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2. Similarly, if I take (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^2, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}=1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is (1 + 1)^2 = 4, so 1*4=4. \n\nTherefore, applying this logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when problems say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in a product, they might be referring to the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning that \\(c\\) terms are also part of the term. So, perhaps the problem is actually expecting me to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \"in\" the product, so I think it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure, so let me try to think differently. Let me compute both possibilities and see which one makes more sense. \n\nIf I take the first approach, where the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, that would mean that every term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nIf I take the second approach, where the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. \n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the first approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): \n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSo, the expansion is:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way. Suppose I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Then, in the product, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Wait, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (if any) from the second part, because if there are \\(c\\) terms, they would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), right? So, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct either because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expansion.

Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check that.

But the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean just the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. Wait, but that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the other part, it would have coefficients that depend on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it would be multiplied by the constant term (if any) of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have additional powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiply it by 6, and that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have extra factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) or \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms unless they somehow affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But since they don't, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. So, actually, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c^k\\), then the entire term would have \\(c^k\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me tackle that next. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes here. So, first, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think I might have confused myself earlier by thinking that the entire expansion would affect the coefficient, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and it's just multiplied by the constant term from the other expansion, which is 20. So, the final coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning, so I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're considering the entire expression, but only looking at the terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each. However, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is when considering the second expression? Wait, no, because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expression has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the problem isn't specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expansions together, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expression, because each term in the second expression gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to, say, \\(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1 + 6/c + 15/c^2 + 20/c^3 + 15/c^4 + 6/c^5 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^5 + 90a^2b^2c^4 + 120a^2b^2c^3 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 36a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2 + 36a^2b^2/c + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 120a^2b^2/c^3 + 90a^2b^2/c^4 + 36a^2b^2/c^5 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. So, yes, 384 is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any specific \\(k\\). So, it's just the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) depend on the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which isn't the case. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because any term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making the overall term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something in \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a factor that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're effectively summing all those contributions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum \\text{terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum \\text{terms} \\), then the product is the sum of all possible products of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and when we collect like terms, the coefficient becomes the product of the two coefficients. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expression, leading to \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but when considering just the coefficient, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But wait, that's not exactly correct because each term in the second sum is a coefficient multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). However, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually the sum of all the products where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is when \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because sometimes when dealing with products, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it this way: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But actually, expanding it, the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering just the coefficient (i.e., setting \\(c = 1\\)), it's 2. So, yes, that works. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, that seems to confirm that the method is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of the coefficients is. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}, \\dbinom{6}{1}, \\dbinom{6}{2}, \\dbinom{6}{3}, \\dbinom{6}{4}, \\dbinom{6}{5}, \\dbinom{6}{6}\\), which are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. If I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when we're asked for the coefficient, we're considering the coefficient without any variables, so we set \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which is 64. Thus, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is then multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, since the variables in each part are different (a, b, c, and 1/c), when we multiply them together, the terms will combine in such a way that the exponents for each variable are additive. But the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression. Wait, but actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me clarify: The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the term that is constant in \\(c\\), i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only that term will result in a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the coefficient is from the second part for the constant term, because if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) part must contribute a term that doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\), which would be the constant term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, as I thought earlier. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
