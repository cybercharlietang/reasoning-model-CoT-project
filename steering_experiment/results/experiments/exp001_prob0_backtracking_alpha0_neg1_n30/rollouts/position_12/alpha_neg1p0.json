    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this interacts with the first part. Since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by 1 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)), the coefficient remains the same. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for the term where the variables are just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some constants and powers of \\(c\\), but when we collect like terms, the coefficient will be the sum of all the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part for terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think: when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), and \\(1\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^5 = 36a^2b^2c^5\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 1 = 6a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not the case. Actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by other terms from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because only when you multiply by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) do you get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), hence \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right because the second expansion isn't just a sum of coefficients; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that can't be right because earlier I got 120. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients. So, when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because only when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) do you get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120. The alternative approach where I set \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients, which would be the total number of terms, but that's not what we need here.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I can treat the other part involving \\(c\\) separately. Wait, but actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by all the terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. But since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, perhaps the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense. So, I think that's the case. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me proceed accordingly. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\):\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from each part:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient we found, 6, is just for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. But since we're multiplying by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we don't care about the powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\); we just need the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and since it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is being multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part's terms are in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is being multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms each of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in the second part are already the \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) terms, and when you multiply by 6, you're just scaling each coefficient by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants, not expressions in variables. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\), \\(15c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = 15c\\), etc. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second part sum to zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, let me find that term.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient would be 384, but that was assuming that we're summing all coefficients, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that would be incorrect because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, so only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because a coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that's a constant, not a polynomial. However, in reality, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion contributes to a different term in the product, such as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, which is it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're considering the term with specific exponents in all variables. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that implies that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the only variables, and \\(c\\) is a constant, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is present in the expression. So, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire product as a product of two independent binomial expansions and focus on how the coefficients combine. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, when expanded, has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in this product. The first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1. The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, the term would be \\(2a^2\\), but wait, that's not correct because when you multiply, you get \\(a^2 \\times c + a^2 \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1. So, if you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2, which is correct. So, in this case, the coefficient is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64,"

    "text": " So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplied together. Wait, let me make sure. So, when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because then when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) that constant term, so it'll contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, if the term in the second expression had a non-zero power of \\(c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. So, I think I need to find the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs at \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

But in the entire expression, after expanding both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by it, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, they're treating the entire expression as a product, and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I think the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to parse it again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is usually a number. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me check if the problem is correctly stated. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second part. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables, but that would require more work. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, perhaps they want the sum of all coefficients, which would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression. But the problem didn't specify, so I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I expand the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this polynomial. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let's explore that possibility. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can consider the product term by term. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and we need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all terms, but that would require more context. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, but that seems unclear. Given that the problem is from a math problem set, I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that would require specifying the exponents of all variables. Since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps they are considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Given that, I think the answer is 120. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer they're looking for.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n\n1.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes the product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second expansion. Wait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply that constant term by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part can be any term, but since it's multiplied, the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but actually, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will just add another factor, but since we don't care about \\(c\\), we just need the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum over all terms in the second expansion. But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we don't care about \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think carefully.\n\nWait, when you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(A \\times B\\), where \\(A\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(B\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(B\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(A\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not a single coefficient, because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that the product includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(A\\)'s term. Wait, but that would be incorrect because the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems high. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times 6, which is 36, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). That suggests that maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would be 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the entire second part, which is 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's not a number, it's an expression. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that the product is a single expression, and we need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would mean that in the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, we have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, considering the structure of the problem, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me think about this again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's a typo or misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because it's not a standard way to present the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which seems high, but mathematically, that's the case.\n\nWait, let me think of it another way. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nBut wait, in standard problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you usually specify all variables.

I'm a bit confused about how this part interacts with the first part because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps it just multiplies the coefficient by a constant. But actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is also being raised to the 6th power, so it will have multiple terms, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, the second part's expansion would contribute a constant factor, meaning the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the first part, each term in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add up. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by the entire second expression. Wait, no, that's not right either because when you expand the entire product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that was incorrect because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which is when \\(c = 1\\), but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term of 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that's not quite right because the second polynomial is multiplied by each term of the first. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that would mean 6 * 64 = 384, but that contradicts the earlier result. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second polynomial's terms are in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is only the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. The other terms will result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), where the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a constant term of 20 when expanded. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the expansion will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, I think I need to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then realize that when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part would contribute to the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part would have a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it would affect the overall coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because the expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) parts. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But if that's the case, then the coefficient would include terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean considering all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me try that approach. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have exponents \\(6 - 2m\\) for each term. We need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the \\(c\\) term. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as the only variables, and treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all coefficients from the second part, which would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120 as I calculated earlier. Let me check that again. From the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems plausible. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me see if that makes sense. So, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the terms that don't involve \\(c\\)? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, let me think about that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well.

Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me clarify. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by each of the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term from the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected by the second expansion because the second expansion only contributes to the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't contribute to the \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you're just adding more factors, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by 1 (from the second part when it's 1, but actually, no, because the second part is a sum of terms). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, is a sum of terms each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just 6; it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion's terms are each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me check that again. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think of it another way. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, every term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the second expansion is \\((c + 1)\\), which when multiplied by \\((a + b)^2\\) gives terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, even though the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 2. So, my earlier reasoning was wrong because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because only the constant term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms in the second expansion will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they'll give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion being 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, only the constant term affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because the other terms introduce \\(c\\) powers, which change the term. So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nLet me confirm this by expanding both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant, which is what we're looking for. So, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(20 \\times 6 = 120\\). Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, that part seems straightforward. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in the first part, and the second part is another binomial expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). That is, when multiplying the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute constants when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a constant factor. Wait, no, that's not correct because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, if we're just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's indeed 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient factor. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that would be the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, in which case, it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple, and the problem includes the second part, so I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, yes, it would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120 because that's the term where \\(c^0\\), but wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from each term, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, which is correct because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384, which matches the manual calculation. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\n3. **Multiply the two expansions**:\n   The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.

So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion. So, let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, actually, the way it's written, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in the second expansion and then multiply it by 6. \n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which includes terms like c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c\u00b2, etc., the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different power of c. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, regardless of the power of c, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, so substituting c = 1, we get (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2c^0, meaning the term where a\u00b2b\u00b2 is multiplied by c^0. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I originally thought. That makes more sense because it's a specific term, not just the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 regardless of c. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2c^0, which would be 120. \n\nLet me double-check. The term a\u00b2b\u00b2 comes from (a + b)^4, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, the term c^0 comes from (c + 1/c)^6, which is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2c^0, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 times c^k for some k, then we would have to consider that, but since it's just a\u00b2b\u00b2, perhaps it's implied that we're looking for the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I were to multiply out the entire expression, each term in (a + b)^4 is multiplied by each term in (c + 1/c)^6. So, the term a\u00b2b\u00b2 from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^2, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2/c^2, etc. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, so (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 if we were considering all possible powers of c. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, which I think refers to the term where the exponent of c is zero, so that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in reality, the problem is written as \"the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2\" in the entire product. So, perhaps it's referring to the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 regardless of the c terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when the exponent of c is zero, so 120. \n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in a and b, and one in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term a\u00b2b\u00b2 from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, etc. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 is 384, regardless of the power of c. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, which in the product would have multiple terms with different c exponents. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2c^0, which is 120, as I originally thought. Because if it's just a\u00b2b\u00b2, without specifying c, then perhaps it's referring to the term where c^0 is present. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that it's expecting the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, considering only the a and b terms, and the rest is ignored, but that doesn't make much sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the product includes terms with different powers of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all possible c terms, which would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I think I might have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c, when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number but a polynomial. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in c. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the term where c^0 is present is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nThus, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Therefore, we multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression, but only when the second term is a constant (i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.

So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on. The second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's as if we're treating the entire second part as a single term. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient would then include the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That is, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's explore that possibility.

We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression is multiplied by another polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) polynomial.

But in this case, the first factor is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, we can consider that each term in the product will be the product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the only contribution comes from the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which we're not interested in. Wait, but actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem to expand this. The binomial expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when considering \\(c^0\\), gives a coefficient of 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're interested in. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient from the first part as 6. Then, for the second part, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, the combined coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. So, yes, that should be the correct coefficient.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product depends on both parts of the expression, and that the second part contributes a factor that is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), since we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\). So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by calculating the coefficient from each part of the product and multiplying them together. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and it's multiplied by whatever comes from the other part of the expression? Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the other part might contribute a factor that affects the overall coefficient. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Hmm, I'm confused now. Maybe I need to clarify the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but considering all possible terms. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m \\times \\text{something}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. \n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the expansion is a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, yes, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in the second part, I get the sum of its coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm assuming that all terms in the second expansion are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. \n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write out the expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would still result in a polynomial, which isn't a coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what is being asked. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that doesn't consider the second part of the product. \n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and any \\(m\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, I'm confused now. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think I need to figure out which interpretation is correct. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. If I have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then in the product, each term will have some power of \\(a\\), some power of \\(b\\), and some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would typically be a constant, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I think the intended answer is 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't standard. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient is a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6, because that's the coefficient in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so it does affect the coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that it's the sum of all the coefficients of terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation makes more sense. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the context of the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. \n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut to make sure, let me go through the process again. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m"

Wait, is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me check that. \n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term would have a specific power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes with a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. Then, each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is a scalar multiple, 6) by each term in the second polynomial, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we need to sum up all the coefficients from each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\)? But in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would give us the total coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which we've already determined is when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each term in the second part, when multiplied by 6, it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), multiplied by 6. But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which seems too large. Wait, no, because \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems incorrect because each term in the expansion has a specific power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not intended. So, let's consider that. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the term in the expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Then, from the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, multiplying these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering all coefficients regardless of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's not a specific term but rather a term that's part of a larger expression with different powers of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., exponent zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it might just multiply the coefficient from the first part by whatever the expansion of the second part is. Wait, but no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms in the second expression, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a factor that is the sum of all the terms in their expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is a product of two polynomials. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. Let me write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying those together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part contributes a constant factor (the sum of all its terms, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the constant term). So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found in each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the entire coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that term will be present in the product, but multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient very large. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing something here. \n\nLet me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nSo, I have already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. \n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should consider that when I multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms in the second part would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, my reasoning seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, and that's the coefficient we're looking for because \\(c^0\\) is the same as not having \\(c\\) in the term, so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, including the constant term. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), which is just the constant term, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem. \n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term (20) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms will have a power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product just 6 times 20? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second part will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product comes from the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Since these are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nJust to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is 0 because the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so no constant term. Wait, that might not be the best example. Let me pick another one. \n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 2. So, the coefficient is 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(2ab\\) times \\(2\\), but wait, no. Wait, actually, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2, and \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the expansion is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the constant term is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^k b^{2 - k}\\) times the coefficients of \\(c^0\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term in the first expansion; the highest power is \\(a^2\\). Wait, maybe this isn't the best example. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^0c^2\\) would be 1 * 1, \\(a^2b^0c^1\\) is 1 * 2, but wait, no, the second expansion is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the terms are \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2\\), you get \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) (which is \\(a^2b^0\\)) is 2. Similarly, the term \\(2ab\\) from the first expansion would multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2ab/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 4. And the term \\(b^2\\) would multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), and \\(b^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 2. \n\nBut in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't present in the product because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because \\(b\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't have \\(b\\). So, perhaps my initial approach is correct only when the variables are separate. \n\nWait, in the original problem, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms in the first expansion are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in the second expansion are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I'm confident with that answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying these coefficients together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{"

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that's confusing. Let me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be ignored because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the entire expression is considered as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would be \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), etc. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a separate expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in a different part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, and the only term that would result in a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is when it's multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, the overall coefficient would be the product of the two individual coefficients. \n\nSo, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficients multiply together, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would just be 6, but that doesn't make sense in the context of the entire expression because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^4\\) or something from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but that seems a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term should have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which have coefficients. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion? Because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that wasn't specified. If that's the case, then I need to find the term where in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which would be the middle term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), and the term where the exponent is 0 is when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6, the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part at all. But that seems unlikely because the expression is a product of both. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this ask for the coefficient of a specific term that includes variables from both parts. But in this case, it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Hmm, I'm still a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Yeah, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

That suggests that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Or does the entire product affect the coefficient somehow? Hmm, maybe I need to think about how the two parts interact. Let me see. The expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are exponents from the second expansion. But the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it just scales the coefficient. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in different variables, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m (1/c)^n\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the terms in the second polynomial don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, it's just scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the coefficient of that term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a scaling factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but is that the case? Let me think. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c, 1/c)\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(P(a, b)\\) by \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is scaled by the entire \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that's how you find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\), I get \\(Q(1, 1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But wait, in reality, when you multiply out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 \\times b^0 \\times c^0\\) times \\(b^2 \\times c^0\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Wait, no, actually, in this simple case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2 \\times b^0 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) and \\(b^2 \\times a^0 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), but no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^0\\) is just \\(a^2\\), and when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), it's \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), which doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term. Similarly, \\(b^2\\) multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, actually, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. But according to my earlier reasoning, I would have thought it's 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, my earlier reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait, so that means that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, they don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nWait, but in the simple case I tried earlier, that didn't hold because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I got a non-zero coefficient, but in reality, there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Let me try to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are such that \\(m + n = 6\\). But the problem is only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Because each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) contributes a factor that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but earlier, when I tried a simpler case, that didn't hold. Let me check that again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But according to my earlier logic, it would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which contradicts the actual result. Therefore, my reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. In the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut in the simpler case, when I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But according to this logic, it would be 1 times 2 = 2, which is wrong. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the problem, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m (1/c)^n\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nIn the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But when I actually expand it, I get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient should be zero. Therefore, my reasoning is incorrect. \n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the problem is asking. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from the two expansions where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But as I saw in the simple case, that doesn't hold because the coefficient should be zero, but according to that logic, it's non-zero. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then you have to consider both the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and the \\(c\\) parts. \n\nLet me try that approach. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to find this, I need to consider terms where in \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), we have a term that results in \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both parts. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. In \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. That happens when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. Since the total number of terms is 6, the constant term occurs when we have 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because we're choosing 3 positions out of 6 to be \\(c\\), and the remaining 3 will be \\(1/c\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire product, how much does \\(a^2b^2\\) get multiplied by, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut in that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simple case, that didn't hold because the coefficient was zero, but according to this logic, it would be 2. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I"

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? But that can't be right because the second part has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., and the coefficient for each of these would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second part. But if the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the variables are separate. Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate expansion. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of the individual terms. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\), then when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because they are separate variables. But that can't be, because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied. So, for example, if you have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me think again: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in c, the result would have terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together, but that would require knowing the specific power of c, which isn't specified. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, which would be 6 times 64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve a or b. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that would be a different approach. Wait, let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention c, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 2. But in reality, the term \\(a\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ac\\) is 1 and the coefficient of \\(a/c\\) is 1. So, if the problem were asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of c, it would be 1 + 1 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) regardless of c would be 2 as well. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is 64.\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a constant factor. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify. Actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, which do involve \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and sum them up to find the total coefficient? Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I denote the first part as \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and the second part as \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the product is \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a sum of terms like \\( \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k} \\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6) by each term in the second expansion, each such product will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64 \\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, each term from the second expansion contributes its own coefficient to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let's think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\) from the first part, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the total coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's compute the product: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^0\\) would only be from \\(a^2 * c\\) and \\(a^2 * 1/c\\), but in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a coefficient of 1 times \\(c + 1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 1 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. That matches. So, in that case, the reasoning holds. Similarly, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The first expansion is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only concerned with the coefficient, not the specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Since each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, to recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the sum of coefficients from the second part (64), giving \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
