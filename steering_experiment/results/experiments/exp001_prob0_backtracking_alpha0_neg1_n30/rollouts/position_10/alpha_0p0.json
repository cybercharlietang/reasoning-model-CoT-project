    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but that second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so does that affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(c\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficients of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms in the first polynomial remain unchanged when multiplied by the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a separate variable, it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply it by the first factor, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first factor, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second factor, but that can't be right because the second factor is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial has no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the terms in the second polynomial. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit confusing. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not possible because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two polynomials, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each such term would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would just be 6 times the coefficient of that power in the second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that coefficient becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would become \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms is a separate term in the expanded product. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because coefficients are usually constants, not variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would still result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, let me check that. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which was 6. Then, I realized that since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in that expansion. I calculated that using the binomial theorem, found that \\(k = 3\\) gives the term with \\(c^0\\), and the coefficient was 20. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I think I might have initially confused myself by considering the entire expansion, but once I realized that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it made more sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's correct. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, let me make sure. Suppose the first part is \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and the second part is \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some expression with terms involving } c^k \\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but is that accurate? Let me think again. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and all those contributions add up. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider cross terms or something else, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). So, if you're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor and the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Because when you distribute, each term in the second factor adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, let me just check if that makes sense. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding those up: 1 + 6 = 7, +15 = 22, +20 = 42, +15 = 57, +6 = 63, +1 = 64. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. So, multiplying that by 6 gives 384. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire product as two separate expansions multiplied together. The first expansion has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion has a sum of coefficients 64. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2. So, yes, that works. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2^2 = 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let me check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these, the \\(a^2\\) term would be \\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), so 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, that works too. \n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me also consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient directly. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part is 20. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part has multiple terms, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, not just the constant term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, that brings me back to the same conclusion: 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), as I did earlier, which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the second part as a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The sum of its coefficients is the same as evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another way. Suppose I write the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that any term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), which can be any even integer from -6 to 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but that's exactly what I did earlier. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part? Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), but the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might mean that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but that seems a bit confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\), but in the product, it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which include various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, and the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which will have coefficients from the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=-6}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{(6 + m)/2}\\), but that seems complicated. Wait, maybe a better way is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, so each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term from the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Similarly, for \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the problem might be treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term that's independent of \\(c\\). But in that case, the only way to have a term independent of \\(c\\) is if the second expansion contributes a constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when expanding. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But now I'm confused because I don't know which interpretation is correct. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's the first case, where it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to see if the problem is from a textbook or something, but since I don't have that context, I'll have to go with my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is zero, which is impossible because \\(1/c\\) would be undefined, so that can't be the case. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But just to make sure, let me check this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the same as the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, scaling up, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then it's the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. But since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to multiply this 6 by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, actually, no. Because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem might be asking for the coefficient in the product, considering all terms. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the entire second part is. But that can't be, because the second part is another binomial expansion. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that seems incorrect because the second expansion isn't a single term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables and \\(c\\) as another variable, so the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only concerned with the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a single number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would require me to consider both expansions together. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). As before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we need to find all terms in the second expansion where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), because when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the exponent of \\(c\\). So, solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two terms together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, the second part's coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check if there are other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I don't think so because in the first expansion, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the one with coefficient 6, and in the second expansion, the only term with \\(c^0\\) is the one with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is only concerned with the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is just another variable that's being multiplied. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct, that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, the term is 20 * \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when I multiply that by the 6 from the first expansion, I get 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number, so that can't be the case. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving 120 as the coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so that can't be right. Therefore, I must have misread the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, that would make sense, and the coefficient would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out the product more explicitly. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there are other terms in the product that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). But no, because the other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless we're considering \\(c^0\\). So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 120. So, that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be. Therefore, the problem must be implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a number, 120.\n\nTherefore, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all terms from the second expansion and multiply them by the 6 from the first part? Wait, no, actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, the second part can be any term, but we just need to consider that it's multiplied by 6. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is a separate polynomial, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that seems to make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables, so perhaps it's just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be multiplied by all the terms in the second part. Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps they just want the coefficient, regardless of the other variables. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then multiply them. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Let me try that approach. So, in the first part, we have \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, we need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero. From earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(20\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's expecting 120. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that might be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a single number. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. So, does that mean the second part can be treated as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient from the second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when considering the product. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Wait, but the second part doesn't have a constant term unless \\(c^0\\) is considered. Let me check that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other factors must cancel out the \\(c\\) terms. So, the only way that happens is if the second factor is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply when the variables multiply to give the desired term. So, yes, in this case, since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that happens is when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion. But no, because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the variables are separate. So, the coefficients are multiplied, but the variables remain separate. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n4. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait a second, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, the first part \\((a + b)^4\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the terms from the second part might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. \n\nActually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and it gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the multiplication will just add the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and ignore the second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something involving }c\\text{)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the coefficients from the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as it is from the first part. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part would contribute to different terms in the product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second part is 1, right? Because \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\). But the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), including \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel out is when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the exponent is 0. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's correct.

I need to consider this as well. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That makes me think that maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part of the product, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, so they won't combine with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the first expansion, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the powers of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and we're looking for the case where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning it's a constant term. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me break it down.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But we're only interested in the case where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which we found has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. When I multiply these together, I get 6 \\times 20 \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120\\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 \\times 20 = 120. So, that confirms it.\n\nI think that makes sense.

The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is indeed 384. Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the overall coefficient. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I'm getting terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused. Let me try another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as two separate polynomials multiplied together. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, meaning that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as calculated by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check this by expanding both parts and seeing. Let me try expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) a bit more. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6 c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15 c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15 c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6 c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1 c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, and their sum is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I found earlier. So, that part is correct. \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 \\(a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply this by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like 6 * 1 \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), 6 * 6 \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, up to 6 * 1 \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I need to sum all these contributions. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Looking at the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, if I'm only interested in the term where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then I need to find the term in the expansion where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify. \n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, if we're looking for the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then we need to consider all the terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384 because I was considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct answer is 120, not 384. \n\nLet me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. However, if the second term has a power of \\(c\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^1 = a + b\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), it's zero because all terms have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also zero. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in this case, there are no terms without \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe that's a bad example. \n\nLet me try another example. Suppose \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute this. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \n\n\\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). \n\nNow, multiplying them: \n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n- \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in this expansion because the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but they don't multiply together beyond that. Wait"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at all? Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient doesn't change. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, regardless of the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the entire expression is supposed to be considered, and there's a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) terms. But no, the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\((\\text{something with } a \\text{ and } b) \\times (\\text{something with } c)\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and the rest of the variables (if any) can be anything. But in this case, the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so when I take the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the coefficient is a scalar, and the other part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, the terms in the first polynomial are only involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in the second polynomial are involving \\(c\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms. So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would still be 6, because the other part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so technically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of multiple variables, usually means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each of those terms. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of multiple variables, usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the problem is expecting just the scalar coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, which would include terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the entire expansion of the second part. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the answer is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficient would be scaled by the entire second expansion. Hmm. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression as a product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms, but that's not how coefficients work. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the second part is separate. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to verify. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of those coefficients, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms, perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct because the coefficients in the second expansion are for specific powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each of those coefficients, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, so maybe it's just 6. \n\nI'm getting more confused now. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, the answer is 6. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, each term in the product will be a term from the first polynomial multiplied by a term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of the coefficients from the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, perhaps it's just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6=36, and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number, but rather, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the second polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the context where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are variables, and the coefficient is a scalar, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me try to see if I can find similar problems or examples. Usually, when you have a product of two polynomials and you're asked for the coefficient of a term that only involves some variables, you can consider the other variables as constants. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a scalar, then perhaps it's 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the second part is separate and doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients, so the answer is 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me try to compute the entire expression to see. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): \n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\("

    "text": " So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and their expansion won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Let me think about that. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the other part of the product doesn't affect it. Let me test this idea. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the variables we're looking at. \n\nWait, so maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it gets multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is just 1, but with coefficient 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed just the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when we multiply these together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the only term in the second part that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms is the constant term, which is 20. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion would result in terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, indeed, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, so they don't interfere with each other. That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a sum. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion, and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give us terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all possible terms, meaning that we're summing over all the coefficients from the second part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient in the second expansion for \\(c^k\\) and multiply by 6. But since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me see if that makes sense. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and any term in the second polynomial can be multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients is when all variables are set to 1, so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider the expansion of that part as well? Or does the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remain unaffected by the other part? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't sound right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, actually, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a term in \\(c\\). So, the entire expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can vary. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) from the second part. Wait, but the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless we're considering the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) would be separate. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would include the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Wait, but the second part doesn't have a constant term. Let me see: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, earlier, I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which was 64, but that's incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients. So, actually, I should only consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient that is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But now I'm confused because I have two different answers: 120 and 384. Let me clarify the question again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, we're looking for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer, positive or negative, depending on the expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me check this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) is zero because there are no \\(a b\\) terms. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is zero because in the first expansion, the only terms are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when multiplied by the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b/c\\), none of which are \\(a b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) is zero. So, that suggests that if the first expansion has a term \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\), then when multiplied by the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But in this case, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, there are no \\(a b\\) terms, so that contradicts. Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be wrong. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right either because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But in the small example, that approach gave an incorrect result. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But in the small example, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a b\\) is 1, but in reality, it's zero because there are no \\(a b\\) terms. So, that can't be right either. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms in \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But in the small example, this approach didn't work. Wait, in the small example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a b\\) is zero because there are no \\(a b\\) terms. So, the approach of multiplying the coefficients only works if the variables are the same. Wait, no, in the small example, the variables are different, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) is zero because there's no way to get \\(a b\\) when multiplying by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) is zero, which suggests that when variables are different, the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve the other variables is zero. So, perhaps in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that contradicts the earlier reasoning. I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in our case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). This term can only come from multiplying a term in the first polynomial \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we calculated earlier. In the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which we found earlier to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, since any other term would have a power"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, but no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in the second expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in the second expansion are not just numbers; they have variables attached. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me correct myself. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the entire product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be misapplying how the coefficients interact.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this because I might be missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me take a simpler example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let me expand the entire expression to check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term with \\(ab\\) is \\(2ab \\times c + 2ab \\times 1/c = 2abc + 2ab/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 for each term, but since they're separate, the total coefficient when considering all possible terms is 2 + 2 = 4. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, in the product, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) times \\(c\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(ab\\) times \\(1/c\\) is 2. So, in the entire product, the term \\(ab\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2/c, but that's not a constant coefficient. Hmm, so maybe my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the concept. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) times \\(c\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(ab\\) times \\(1/c\\) is 2. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first expansion. So, in that case, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product being a polynomial in three variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficients. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) was 2 in the first part and 2 in the second part, so the total coefficient was 4, which is 2 * 2. So, that seems to support the approach.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the product of the two expansions more carefully.\n\nThe first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThe second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6.\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but since each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Which, as we calculated, is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to confirm, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients from each expansion? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term \\(x^k y^m\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) such that \\(i + j = k\\) and so on, but in this case, since the variables are separate, the coefficients just multiply. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the coefficient from the first expansion, while the second expansion's terms contribute their coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct, and the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just be a constant coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will contribute to terms in the final product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will have the same coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're just asked for the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(6c^6 a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4 a^2b^2\\), \\(90c^2 a^2b^2\\), \\(120 a^2b^2\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is just the value of the expression when \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that all the terms in the second expansion contribute their coefficients to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, the terms are formed by multiplying terms from each polynomial. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it will give terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each coefficient in the second polynomial is multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.

The coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial coefficient times the appropriate sign, but since we're summing all coefficients, it's equivalent to evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I notice that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as it is, just multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion is a separate part. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that any term from the second expansion will not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because all terms in the second expansion are constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expanded form, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's possible that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Oh, perhaps I misread it. It's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of products from the two expansions. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that logic again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms, each of which is a multiple of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). When we multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\times a^2b^2\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the products of 6 and each term's coefficient in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, I can expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are: when k=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\), k=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\), k=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\), k=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\), k=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\), k=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\), k=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered that this term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I realized that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. Yes, that seems correct. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. This coefficient is then multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, perhaps the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by the first part, but since we're only looking for the term without \\(c\\), maybe I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient we found earlier for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because if we multiply by any other term that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives us a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives us a constant term 20 when \\(m = 3\\).

Hmm, for instance, could there be other terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar multiple, and when multiplied by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms.

I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficients from each part will multiply as well.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the two parts separately. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because any term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in other words, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is that correct? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so when multiplied together, it's 384. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me write it out more formally. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first sum will be multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the term from the second part can be any term, because we're looking for any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is, as I found earlier, 64.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients don't just multiply by the sum. Let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so their coefficients add up. So yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by considering a simpler example. Suppose P(a, b) = a^2b^2 and Q(c) = c + 1/c. Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) = a^2b^2(c + 1/c) = a^2b^2c + a^2b^2/c. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in this product is the sum of the coefficients of c and 1/c, which are 1 and 1, so 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 2, which is 1 (from P) times 2 (sum of coefficients in Q). That matches the idea. So, in our problem, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let me just compute the sum of coefficients in the second part again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, yes, that seems right.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Let's expand both parts and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in this expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Wait, that's the same as \\(6 \\times 64\\), because \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So, that confirms that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on, that approach is correct because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6 gives the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms from both expansions. But since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, but only for the specific term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the product in a more detailed way. Suppose I take the first expansion, which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by each term in the second expansion:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6c^6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36c^4a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90c^2a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90c^{-2}a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36c^{-4}a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6c^{-6}a^2b^2\\)\n\nNow, in the product, each of these terms has a coefficient, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\n- 6c^6: the coefficient is 6, but since it's multiplied by c^6, it's not the term we're interested in for \\(a^2b^2\\).\nWait, no, actually, in the product, each term is \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient from second expansion}\\) times the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients of terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, that adds up to 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term is a monomial involving \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the expansion of this second part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need the constant term from the second expansion. Okay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is there any interaction between the two expansions that could affect the coefficient? Hmm, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, their coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of these two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficients from the second part multiply the coefficients from the first part. But actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we can consider that the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but since the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't being multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, that coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but wait, no, that's not right because the second part is multiplied as a whole. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so we're summing over all possible \\(m\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in a different way. Wait, no, because \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, since each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, since the coefficient from the first part is 6 and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the second expansion, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by expanding a bit more carefully. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be the product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I'm missing anything here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)?

So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), which is a power of \\(c\\). The only way to get a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 20. From earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need to find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if it's multiplied by a non-constant term, then the entire expression would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. Let me confirm that. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the term to be constant, the exponent must be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and it is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but actually, since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. That means that the coefficients for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't depend on the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the second part to contribute a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, yes, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that calculation again. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120? Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as I calculated using the binomial coefficient. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when m=3, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these together, I get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by expanding the expressions more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), let's compute the expansion up to the term where the exponent of c is zero. The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, which matches what I found earlier. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. So, the coefficient becomes 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or are there other terms that could also contribute? Let me think. No, because in the product, any term that includes a c term would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my initial reasoning seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that would indeed be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients? Although I'm not sure if that's necessary here. The problem is only about two variables in the first part and one variable in the second, so binomial theorem should suffice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you take terms from each. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the constant term, it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second. So, that's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the entire expression. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Then, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to sum over all m such that the c terms don't affect the a and b terms. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, but wait, actually, no. Wait, no, because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of c is zero will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could combine with terms in the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could a term with \\(c^1\\) in the second expansion multiply with a term in the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), but that would not be \\(a^2b^2\\), so it wouldn't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for. Similarly, any other exponent of c would result in a term that includes c, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is indeed 120. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the terms are multiplied in the product: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. That's correct because 6 choose 3 is 20.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how this term interacts with the second expansion. \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when we multiply it by terms from the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer? Or do we need to consider the entire expansion? Hmm, I might be misunderstanding. Let me double-check the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's considering the product of these two expressions, and we need the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in that case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because if we multiply by any other term, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). But wait, is that correct? Or is it that when we multiply, each term is multiplied by all terms, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to a term without \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products where the exponents add up to 2 for both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that contributes is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nI think I've got it.

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what this part contributes. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, so does that mean I can treat the second part as a separate expansion and just consider its constant term? Because if I don't care about \\(c\\), I just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term, and then multiply it by 6 from the first part. That way, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving me the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that when multiplied together, they result in a term that doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result is a product where each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is determined by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because it's independent of \\(c\\), then we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that makes sense. So, I was wrong earlier when I thought it was the sum of all coefficients. It's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let me work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since we're multiplying by the entire second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients is 64, but now I'm getting a different approach. Wait, no, actually, the sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But in this case, we're not summing all coefficients; we're specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, it's not the sum of all coefficients, but just the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by another method. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But that contradicts the earlier result of 120. So, I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing two different things. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients: 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier when I thought it was 6 times 64? I think I confused the concept. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, which is correct, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\). However, in this case, we're not summing all coefficients; we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). In the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. I think I was confused earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients, but that's not necessary here. The key is to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think the next step is to consider the entire expression as a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion. I'm a bit confused here because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product terms will involve all three variables. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means that any term in the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and the coefficient is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but the second expansion does involve \\(c\\), how does that affect things? Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to terms where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part is any term, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by each term, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, and the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because substituting a variable with 1 in a polynomial gives the sum of its coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be the constant term, which is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that makes more sense because if I'm looking for the term where the variables are only \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) part must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I should calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's try that approach. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, now I'm getting two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The confusion arises because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term must be exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way that can happen is if the second term is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. I think my initial approach was wrong because I multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, which would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times all possible \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) must be to the zero power. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in each part of the product. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a constant factor when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, but that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, the term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for each \\(m\\), this contributes a term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\), or is there a specific power of \\(c\\) we're considering? Wait, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expression, so it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we would have to find the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm assuming something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) terms are also considered, but we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would require that in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we take the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I calculated earlier, that term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the variables are separate. Wait, no, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms with \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by something else, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a sum over all the coefficients from the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so \\(c^0\\), which would be 20, as I calculated earlier, making the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated earlier. So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in this term is \\(6 - 2m\\). If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = "
