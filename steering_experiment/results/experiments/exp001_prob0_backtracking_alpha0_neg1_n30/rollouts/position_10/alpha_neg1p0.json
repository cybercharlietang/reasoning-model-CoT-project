    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, but wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That makes me think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and when multiplied by 6, it would give the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me compute it again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other part, so when you multiply them together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part has a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything else. Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right.\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, as higher or lower exponents would result in terms that include \\(c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which we found to be 20. Then, the coefficient from the first expansion is 6, so multiplying them gives 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term (c^0 term) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6\u00d720=120. That makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, actually, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but the second part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply by the second expression, you're only affecting the \\(c\\) terms, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, regardless of the other terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply by the second part, you're adding more terms, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but each of those terms is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in that expansion. The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, I can think that since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only influenced by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's multiplied by it. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, leading to 384. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only multiplied by the constants from the second polynomial. Wait, but the second polynomial's terms are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is the constant term. So, maybe I was wrong before. Maybe I should only consider the constant term in the second expansion, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, let's reevaluate. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the constant term in the second expansion because that's the only term that won't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients was 64, but that's only when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, we only need the constant term, which is 20. So, the correct coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, so when multiplied by 20, we get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. Let me write out the first few terms. \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the only term that results in just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term, 20. So, that term is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

Let me re-examine the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when we multiply these two expressions together, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would result in the coefficient being a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which again seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Let me check that. If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem might just be expecting the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a numerical value, considering all possible terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but that's not specified. \n\nWait, let me reread the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is likely not what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nSo, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to consider both parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Specifically, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, but the problem as stated doesn't mention \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) or something else, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial, which is probably not what the problem is asking for. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to parse it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, let me proceed under that assumption, even though it's not explicitly stated. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nTo do that, I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm still overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the original problem. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire product and treating \\(c\\) as a variable that's independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a numerical value, implying that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems incorrect because the problem includes both parts multiplied together. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not quite right because the coefficients in the second part are for different variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this will be a sum of terms, each of which is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. For example, \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4\\), etc., and similarly for other terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is likely not what the problem is asking for. The problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

    "text": " So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately. Wait, no, actually, maybe I need to consider the entire product, but perhaps the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part's terms will just contribute a factor that gets multiplied by 6. But wait, no, because the second part is a separate expression; it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but each of those terms is a power of \\(c\\), so each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms, each with a different power of \\(c\\), but all having \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct either because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, that means that in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in that expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. \n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expression, and the second expression is multiplied by it, each term in the second expression is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6, in steps of 2, perhaps. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in other words, all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Let me check my reasoning again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, as I thought earlier, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm confused now because I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm second-guessing myself because maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. Let me see if that's the case. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. Alternatively, maybe it's a misinterpretation, and the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, to clarify, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because I thought initially that the coefficient would be 120, but that was under the assumption that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, which is it? \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for an example. Let me take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). \n\nNow, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). \n\nExpanding this, we get: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). \n\nNow, if we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there are no \\(b^2\\) terms in the product except for \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\), but those are multiplied by \\(a^0\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there are no terms with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because in the first part, \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power of \\(a\\) is 2, and the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but when multiplied by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), you don't get any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that seems contradictory to my earlier reasoning. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the variables interact. Wait, in the product, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term would have a power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because 6 is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. \n\nWait, but in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second part doesn't have any terms that would combine \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). But in that example, the first part is \\((a + b)^2\\), which has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), you don't get any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the first part only has up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has various terms in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut in my simple example, the first part was \\((a + b)^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. In the original problem, the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my simple example, if I set the first part to have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, say \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part as \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 2 = 12, because the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. Let me check that. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables in the first part, and \\(c\\) is another variable in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\( \\text{something} \\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded as \\( \\text{something else} \\), then each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then that term must come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it will result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part where that term is present. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the two coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**. The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. The question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, let me think about that again. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables are different. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply by the other part, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a power of \\(c\\), so the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from, say, -6 to +6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponent. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. And since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), then 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find a specific coefficient, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) = 2. The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)\\) is 2 (since \\(c=1\\) gives 2). So, 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)\\), which is 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, but in reality, it's 2c + 2, so the coefficients for \\(ab\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 2 and 2, summing to 4. Wait, but in the product, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the way I'm thinking about it is correct. \n\nSo, going back, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in that expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this another way. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a separate expansion. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find its sum of coefficients. Let's do that. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have negative exponents, the sum of coefficients might not just be substituting 1. Let me check. For example, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But wait, no, because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the second part is zero. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expansion. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) from the first expansion and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to +6 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product would be the sum over all terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nWait, but let me just double-check this. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nI think I've considered it from multiple angles now, and each time, the coefficient comes out to be 384. So, I'm confident that the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second"

So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part.

Wait, no, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times something, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the problem isn't asking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's just 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, but that seems odd because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a scalar. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all terms in the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we only consider the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the product includes terms with \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial, not a scalar. That seems unlikely, so I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems odd because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the entire first part by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I consider that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that can't be right because that would imply that every term in the first part is multiplied by 64, which would make the entire product have coefficients scaled by 64, but that's only true if you set \\(c = 1\\), which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because every term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without any constraints. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be a scalar. So, that's the only way the problem makes sense, and that's why the answer would be 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by considering specific terms. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) has coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, I think the problem must have intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient when multiplying them together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the variables are multiplied, so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that means we can treat the \\(c\\) part as a constant when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because any term from the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that might not be the right way to think about it. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because the sum of the coefficients in the second part would be the total contribution from all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, the product will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the value when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and since we're multiplying by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. That makes sense because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, if we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me confirm this approach with an example. Suppose I have two expressions, (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^1b^1 in the product would be the coefficient of a^1b^1 in (a + b)^2, which is 2, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^1, which is (1 + 1) = 2. So, 2 * 2 = 4. Let me expand it: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. (c + 1/c) = c + 1/c. The product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. The coefficient of ab in this product is 2c + 2/c, so the coefficient of ab is 2*(1 + 1) = 4, which matches 2 * 2 = 4. So, my approach seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and any term from the second part will just multiply it by a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

That is, we're looking for all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the product of the coefficients from each part, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable.

But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{[coefficient of }c^0 \\text{ in } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6]\\). So, maybe that's what the problem is asking for. Let me check that. If I consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, we have 6, and from the second part, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.

So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion's coefficients summed. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) would give \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would give \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)), which is 2. So, that works. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 2*2=4, but looking at the product, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in each term is 2, but when considering all terms, it's 2c + 2/c, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 for each term, but when looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of c terms, it's 2 times the sum of coefficients, which is 2*2=4, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 for each c term, so perhaps I'm conflating things. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the overall structure. But in any case, in the original problem, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, only the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just multiplied along, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But when you think about the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute a factor, and since we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire product includes all combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, but it would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficients in the second expansion are the binomial coefficients, and the exponents of \\(c\\) vary. But when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)), so 2. Which is indeed the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 (from \\(2abc\\)) plus 2 (from \\(2ab/c\\)), which is 4, which is the coefficient from the first part (2) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, this seems to hold. \n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) in the second part. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only term that would contribute to a term without \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, it's just 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Do I need to consider this part as well when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect this term because it's multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can treat the two parts separately.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we need to consider all the terms in the second part and sum their contributions. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if the second part contributes a term that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we still have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s, the only way that can happen is if the term from the second part is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in the second part, the constant term is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part? Or is there a possibility that the second part affects the coefficient? Wait, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if any terms from the second expansion affect this specific term. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, regardless of the second expansion. Is that right? Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\), right? So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself without any \\(c\\) terms wouldn't exist unless the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without changing it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these, I get 6*20=120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second part. Wait, but actually, no, because the second part only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are only from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes solely from the first part, and it's multiplied by all terms in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's not the case. Wait, actually, no. Because in the entire product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{something}\\right)\\), where the something is from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", perhaps it's considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and the second part is independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not right either because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\times \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning that \\(c\\) terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement, because if the second part is multiplied, then the entire expression is a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in each term multiplied by some \\(c\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nLet me confirm this by considering an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this. The first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by anything in the second part that would give \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but since the second part is separate, it doesn't involve \\(b\\). So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part if \\(b^2\\) is present, but in the product, the \\(b^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), resulting in \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no way to get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first part while also considering the second part. Wait, but in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a \\(c^0\\) term. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in my small example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part when multiplied by the second part. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. But in the original problem, the first part does have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a \\(c^0\\) term, so when multiplied, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, specifically the term where \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). This term is then multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the entire expression will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But that would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\), because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 384. But that seems too high. \n\nWait, but the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second expansion. But that doesn't make"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does this second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients from each part will multiply together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, actually, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, it will still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Wait, let me clarify. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all its coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 into a polynomial gives the sum of its coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) really just 6 times 64? Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, all these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a term where the exponents cancel out, which is when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3}(1/c)^{3} = 20c^{0}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, which is the middle term. So, if I only consider the constant term in the second part, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which one is correct? \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, if I consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the confusion is whether the problem is considering all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or just the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) also cancel out. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expression. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those would contribute to the coefficient. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120, but that was considering only the constant term. So, I think the correct approach is to consider all terms, so the answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I can look at the problem differently. Let me write out the expansion more formally. \n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nExpanding each part separately:\n\n1. \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n2. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, the coefficients from the second expansion are: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then we would only consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I think it's asking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, so the total is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion's value when considering all terms. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, I think I'm confident now that the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because the second part is a separate variable. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second part would be 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible terms involving \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all its coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we sum the coefficients of the second part by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see how many times that term is multiplied by other terms. Wait, but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be quite right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a product of powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a product of powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't interact with the terms in the second part in terms of combining the variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficients would add up accordingly. Wait, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\) and thus won't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part. \n\nSo, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6! / (3!3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 20, as \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again about how the multiplication works. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I might need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion that multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When I have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand each part separately, the first part gives me terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part gives me terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), depending on how the second expansion goes. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two terms, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me see. For example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, because \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since every term in the second part is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that the case? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the products of the coefficients from the first expansion and the coefficients from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part's coefficients are all multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part adds a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's expand it to check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together: \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes 2c and 2/c. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2*(1 + 1) = 4, which matches. So, yes, the method seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Now, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe I don't need to worry about this part?

But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\)? Wait, no, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire product, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) exponents. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6. Then, when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), you need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely scenario is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Let me verify this by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.

So, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which will have multiple terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part evaluated at \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be something, but we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms.

Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and since we're multiplying by the entire second expansion, which includes all powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients. But wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not the case. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because the coefficient should be a constant, not an expression. So, I think my initial approach was correct: to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to consider the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because that's the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, allowing the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to remain as is. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression.

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but is that correct? Let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but each of those terms has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a constant. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) it's 6 * 6, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing over all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes all the terms from the second expansion. But I think the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with certain coefficients. The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to check the sum of coefficients. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), which confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how the second part affects it. Wait, but hold on, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part's terms are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be 6 multiplied by \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 1, and there are \\(2^6 = 64\\) terms. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables are different: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) vs. \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms in the first polynomial don't interact with the terms in the second polynomial in terms of variables. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the variables are separate, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, I think I'm confusing the concepts here.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since the variables are different, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not affected by the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should just be a number, not a function of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the original coefficient (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6, and the \\(c\\) terms just tag along. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\) and terms in the second polynomial that multiply to give any term (since the variables are different). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms in the second polynomial don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only then would the term be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. All other terms would have factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the expression, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^m\\) where \\(m\\) varies from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, it is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so total coefficient would be 2. But in reality, the product is \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1, so when you consider the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial with coefficients 1 and 1. But if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 2, because each term in \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1, but the sum of the coefficients is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, in our problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it, I think the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're only concerned with the part of the product that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). The \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for a specific term, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems off because the problem is likely expecting a specific coefficient, not a product with all terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but the problem doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), so I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would cancel out, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables, so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a different variable. Wait, that can't be right because the problem includes both parts multiplied together. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, maybe I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check that again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since the expression is a product of two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6*20=120. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me see if I can find more clues. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term, so the coefficient would be 6*20=120. Let me see if that makes sense. If I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, maybe I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^m\\), where \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6*20=120. But since it's not specified, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check with an example. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a different case. Alternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying by \\((a + b)^2\\), we get terms like \\(a^2c^2 + a^2*2 + a^2*1/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6*20=120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 384. Wait, but in my earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, perhaps the problem is different because in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists, but when multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, it's spread out. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, making the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems more plausible. Let me confirm that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 20, as I calculated earlier. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me see if I can find another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first part contributes \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) or something like that.

Or maybe it's considering the entire expression and looking for the term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something, but since the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's implying that we're looking for the coefficient in the expanded form, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables.

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because we're supposed to find a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but that seems tricky because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

So, let's check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well.

Wait, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But actually, no, because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), all those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each term contributing \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, since the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n=6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second expansion is separate, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then indeed, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just double-check by calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), correct. So, 6 * 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, that part is clear. Now, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the overall coefficient. Wait, but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is from the second part when it's raised to the power of 6? Wait, no, because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if there's any term in the second expansion that affects \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient from the second part must be 1 when we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Wait, no, actually, let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only happen if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), right? Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have those \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), we'll get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term, giving us the desired term. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, and the rest is part of the expression involving \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because when you multiply by 6, you're essentially scaling the entire second expansion by 6, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion. But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

But that seems like it's treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, looking back at the problem, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about it another way. When you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would require summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 384. \n\nLet me try to see if that makes sense. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), resulting in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me check the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the expansion as a whole, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simplistic because the second part is also raised to the 6th power.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let me first compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they multiply together.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense either because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all the terms from the second expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), as I derived earlier. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more probable that it's asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\), making the answer 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Or do I? Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, the terms will involve both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so I need to sum all those possibilities.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each term from the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.

Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion.

Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the entire coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the entire expansion. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction.

So, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving a coefficient of 6. Then, the term from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each m from 0 to 6. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is presented as a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's if we're considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on c, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of c is zero. That would make more sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's try that approach.\n\nSo, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of c is zero. That is, we need the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a variable, but the problem is only asking about a and b. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high.\n\nWait, but if we consider that each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. That seems unlikely, though.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part. But that would be too easy, and the presence of the second part suggests that it's part of the problem. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, giving a coefficient of 6. Then, for each m from 0 to 6 in the second part, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum over m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in c, but the problem didn't specify any constraints on c. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is simply 6, the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying by each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way that the product can have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by some term from the second expansion. However, the term we're interested in, \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But wait, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, no, because \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a polynomial in \\(c\\) as well. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for the coefficient of a specific term, they might be considering the term in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. Wait, but in the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so maybe the variables are separate, and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just a constant. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, but perhaps only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let's think differently. When you have two separate variables in the product, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product are combinations of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all treated together, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) part, and just multiplied the coefficients, I would get 6 * something, but that something would be the entire expansion, which isn't a number. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
