    "text": " \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that again: 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. That's correct too. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply them, the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is to multiply the constant term from the second polynomial with the corresponding term from the first polynomial. So, yes, that would be the product of the constant term from the second polynomial and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.
