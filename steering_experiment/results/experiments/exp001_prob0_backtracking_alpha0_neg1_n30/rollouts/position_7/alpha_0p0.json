    "text": " I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I can just consider the part of the expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, I might need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can just take the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because that would imply that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times something, but I think that's not correct because the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, making the entire expression have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) come from the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling it by the coefficient of each term in the second expansion. So, to find the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, in this case, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 from the first part, and each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), then when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each of those coefficients, resulting in the total coefficient being 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when considering the term that doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by it. So, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. Therefore, when we multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just carry along the coefficient from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term without \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or is it asking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms? Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all terms, but only the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the coefficient when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term attached. So, that means we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by each term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a constant term, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that calculation again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6*6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the only contribution? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\) terms, those would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m (1/c)^n\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Because any other term from the second part would add a \\(c\\) term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), which are different terms. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the second factor contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, yes, it's 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), it would be different. But as it is, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part gives 20 for the constant term, so their product is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), these become \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, among all these terms, only \\(20a^2b^2\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire second expression evaluated at \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific term, it's not just multiplied as a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term is a combination. Therefore, the only way to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by a constant term in the second expansion, as any other term would have a \\(c\\) component. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The first expansion gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second expansion gives terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., and the only term without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}=4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}=4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}=1\\). So, yes, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients shouldn't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the rest of the expression as a constant multiplier for that specific term. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, if I have two separate expressions multiplied together, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other involving \\(c\\), then the terms in one don't affect the coefficients of terms in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they would create new variables, not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again. \n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it would be multiplied by every term in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), that would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Is the constant term indeed 20? Let me verify by expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) more carefully. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as I did before. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). That seems correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that in the expansion, the middle term when the exponents cancel out is when \\(m = 3\\), which is the 4th term (since m starts at 0). So, yes, that term is indeed the constant term and equals 20. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider the entire expression. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\) attached. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n4. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems solid.

So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just about \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of this second part as well. The question is, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But let me make sure. \n\nLet me think: when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then will the term not have any \\(c\\) in it, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by a term from the second expansion, that term must also have \\(c^0\\) so that the \\(c\\) parts cancel out. \n\nWait, actually, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. \n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.

Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because they are multiplied in the original expression, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is when \\(k = 2\\).

Hmm, so I need to consider both parts together. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect it? Or does it? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might need to consider if any terms in the second expansion can contribute to a term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the only way that can happen is if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, right? Because if I multiply it by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of the term that is 1 in the second part. But wait, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is there a term that is 1? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the term that is 1 in the second expansion is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term 1 from the second part, each with their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, which is the term that is 1. So when I multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's not right because the first part is already 6a^2b^2, so when multiplied by 20, it's 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me just confirm that there's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\). Suppose I took a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^k\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only possible way is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, yes, that's the only contribution. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) of 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), and I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. When I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas multiplying by other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, which would change the term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nSo, I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(20\\).\n\nNow, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, the constant term is \\(20\\). So, multiplying them gives \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The binomial coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can treat the other part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get different terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling it by each coefficient in the second expansion, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, for example, if you have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6. So, for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, the coefficient becomes 6 * sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\).

When we expand this, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\).

Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). When expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\).

But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem isn't specifying any particular power of \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but that can't be because \\(B\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that any term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges depending on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k=2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, it doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as a single expression. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're not considering \\(c\\), we have to sum over all \\(m\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because for each \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I'm summing over all \\(m\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other terms. Let me think about that. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply by the second expression, you're adding more terms, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression, since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I see. So, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the other terms with \\(c\\) would just be part of the coefficient. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying it's a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. That would give me a numerical coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that logic. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then that would be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) cancels out. So, I need to find that constant term. \n\nAlright, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the constant term from the second part. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems right.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to consider whether the terms from the second expansion will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, hold on. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand that using the binomial theorem, I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\), right? So, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, because otherwise, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would introduce some \\(c\\) terms which I don't want.\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that we are looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power and wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I thought earlier. So, to find the term where the exponent is zero, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, including the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that all? Because when I multiply the two expansions, I'm considering all possible combinations, but I'm only interested in the term where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion's constant term is 20, multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives \\(20a^2b^2\\). But are there any other terms in the second expansion that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the first expansion?\n\nWait, no, because any term from the second expansion that isn't the constant term would have a power of \\(c\\) in it, which would make the product term have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so it wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, only the constant term from the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if the first expansion has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second expansion has a term \\(c^k\\), then the product term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, my initial thought was correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me recalculate the binomial coefficients.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But no, because the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term should not have any \\(c\\) factors. So, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to that. Therefore, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving us the term:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we find \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the expansions \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean I can just consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's multiplied by it. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second will just add to the exponent of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) would be a term, and \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\) would be another term, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means, in the entire expansion, I need to find all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each such term is just the product of the coefficients from both parts. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, it's just the product of the coefficients. But no, that's not correct because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient, say, \\(k\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) with coefficient 6 times \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think I misunderstood the problem earlier. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself would only occur if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, I need to find the term in the second polynomial where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that coefficient by 6.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let's reevaluate. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me double-check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think my second approach is correct, and the first approach was wrong because I didn't consider that the problem is looking for a term without any \\(c\\) dependence. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That means the terms will be:\n\n- When k=0: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When k=1: \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3b\\)\n- When k=2: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2b^2\\)\n- When k=3: \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot ab^3\\)\n- When k=4: \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Got that part down. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so perhaps each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part. So, maybe the second part doesn't affect this coefficient because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms in the second expansion don't affect it because they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so maybe I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the other terms in the second expansion don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they involve \\(c\\) terms, which are separate variables. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) since \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) evaluated at c=1 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Wait, that might be a way to think about it. Let me check: If I set c=1, then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression when c=1 is \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when c=1, all terms in the second expansion become 1, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by 64, which would indeed make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6*64=384. But wait, is that the right approach? Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when c=1, which is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in c. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, so that's 2^6=64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in the first expansion being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be a term in a product of polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. So, yeah, I think that's correct. Let me check with an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, in this example, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but there's no \\(b\\) in the second part, so \\(a^2\\) times \\(c\\) is \\(a^2c\\), and \\(a^2\\) times \\(1/c\\) is \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) times \\(c\\) is \\(2ab c\\), and \\(2ab\\) times \\(1/c\\) is \\(2ab/c\\). \\(b^2\\) times \\(c\\) is \\(b^2 c\\), and \\(b^2\\) times \\(1/c\\) is \\(b^2/c\\). So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, in the original problem, since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^4 c^6\\), \\(a^4 (1/c^6)\\), \\(a^3b c^5\\), \\(a^3b (1/c^5)\\), etc. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 (1/c^6)\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2 c^6\\) or anything like that. So, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would mean the coefficient is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But wait, in my earlier example with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c=1\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. That makes sense.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c=1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6*64=384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach and the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of this polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part, we have:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's see, when \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the original expression is the product of the two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the entire expression is the product of the two sums, which can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. From the first part, as I found earlier, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But in the product, this term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, actually, no. Because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the variables are different. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed. Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, we have a term with \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just becomes that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives us 2^6 = 64. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check another way. Suppose I consider the product as two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). Since they are multiplied together, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and its coefficient is 6. Then, when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is multiplied by this, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the respective coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we have to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. That gives us 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as a product of two independent binomial expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, with coefficient 6, and the second part can be any term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the second part, it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each term in the product is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 -k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\), and we're interested in terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be anything from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the respective coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. That seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but when considering just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to add up all those contributions. \n\nAlternatively, if we were asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which means summing over all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1. If I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be 1 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)\\) has coefficients 1 and 1, summing to 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, it works. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 2 + 1) = 4\\). So, the coefficient would be 1 * 4 = 4. But wait, in reality, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 1 * 1 = 1, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, and coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 1 * 1 = 1. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches 1 * 4. \n\nSo, applying this logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider the multinomial theorem. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can treat this as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, if we think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is obtained by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, 64.

The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion, when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) becomes \\(a^2b^2\\), that implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means I have to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I need to consider the other part as well? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)?\n\nLet me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be various exponents. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, in the product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, how do I find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning because sometimes when variables are involved, especially with different exponents, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me think again. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which has various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a factor that is a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds another coefficient in front.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is combined with each term from the second, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, their exponents remain the same, while the coefficients get multiplied by each term's coefficient in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2, I think. But when I multiply them, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only from the first part, and \\(c\\) is only from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If I denote \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) another way. The sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is indeed \\(Q(1)\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the sum of coefficients, maybe I could think of the product as a product of polynomials and use generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part's expansion would add more terms, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression's expansion. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not possible because the second part has multiple terms involving \\(c\\), so how can \\(a^2b^2\\) have a single coefficient? Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the first polynomial are multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second part. Because if there's a \\(c\\) term, it would be part of the term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant multiple of some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a multiple to the coefficient. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. However, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), those terms would have to have \\(c^0\\), meaning \\(k = 0\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless \\(k = 0\\). Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponent will be 6 when \\(k=0\\), 4 when \\(k=1\\), 2 when \\(k=2\\), 0 when \\(k=3\\), -2 when \\(k=4\\), -4 when \\(k=5\\), and -6 when \\(k=6\\). So, there is a term with \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(k=3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, that means when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., without any \\(c\\) terms) is when we multiply by the constant term \\(20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, initially, I thought to multiply by the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, but now I realize that only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me verify this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term contributes. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check the expansions again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(k=2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, that's correct.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). For \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we have \\(k = 3\\). The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

    "text": " I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait a second, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply out the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I actually don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product will be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient, so the entire expression becomes the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply them, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), where \\(k + m = 6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what the \\(c\\) part is. So, each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's like we're looking for all possible combinations where the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so we just sum up all the coefficients from the second polynomial. That makes sense, so I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me expand both expressions separately and then see how the coefficients combine. So, first, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient contributed to \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) term is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when taking the product of their expansions. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent part involving \\(c\\) can be anything, so we have to sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's again 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have two expressions: \\(P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(Q(c) = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\) would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\). Since \\(P(a, b)\\) has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the product as a polynomial in four variables \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we substitute \\(c = 1\\), as I did earlier, which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and sum the coefficients:\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 &= \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), term \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), term \\(c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), term \\(c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), term \\(c^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), term \\(c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), term \\(c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), term \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the problem differently. For example, if I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's consistent across all approaches. So, I feel confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables are separate.

Because when you distribute, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, all the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's multiplied by it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a separate binomial expansion, and when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^n = 2^n\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the entire product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has multiple terms. Actually, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, you're effectively taking each term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the case where the second part contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), then when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If the second part has terms with \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then those would contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. So, first, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let's compute that. As I had earlier, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in multiple terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, when this is multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only come from the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), i.e., \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:** Multiply the coefficients from each expansion to get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, the only terms that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are from the first part, right? Because the second part, when expanded, will only have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any other variables. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times that expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't seem right either because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the second expansion would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect their exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought about setting \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which was 64, but that approach was wrong because it would give the total sum, not the specific term. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiply by 6 to get 120. Let me double-check that. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them together gives 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 120 seems correct. Alternatively, if I expand both parts separately and then multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Now, I'm specifically looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient when \\(k = 2\\), because that would give me \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can expand this part as well using the binomial theorem. Let's denote this part as \\(D = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding \\(D\\), we get \\(D = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in \\(D\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(D\\). So, when I multiply them together, I need to consider all possible combinations of terms from each expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of this as multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the entire \\(D\\) expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I realize that the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, actually, that's not quite right. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand both parts separately, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) and so on. However, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient we're looking for is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms are independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms in the original expressions. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each of those terms contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since the \\(c\\) part is just a scalar multiple for each term). Alternatively, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient we're seeking is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Let's try that. Let \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression can be written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would again be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify this by considering specific terms. Let's take the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. The sum of these coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I did earlier. So, when I multiply the 6 from the first part by 64, I get 384, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the \\(c\\) expansion just scales it. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts and multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in each multiplication by a term from the \\(c\\) expansion, but since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the two coefficients. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 64 from the second part, giving 384. I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, let's think about the expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, the entire expression is this term multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms each with a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let's compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. That's correct. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. That's correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? Let me check that. If \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, so when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the terms in each factor. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's like multiplying by 1 in terms of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has its own terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with c}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), right? So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving us a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I'm considering all terms regardless of \\(c\\). But actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the second part could have negative coefficients as well, depending on the term. Wait, no, because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, regardless of their sign. So, if the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, you're scaling the entire first part by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant coefficient when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is being multiplied by this, the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the second part scales the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding, the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem might be expecting a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second part, you're scaling the entire first expansion by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the coefficient should indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because the expression is a product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try another approach. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), but considering only \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. So, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value is 1024, but the sum of all coefficients is 1024, which includes all terms. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, so that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but when I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 1024, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is part of that sum. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), the value is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is less than 1024, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. Let me compute the product when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, the expression is \\((1 + 1)^4 * (1 + 1)^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, so when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes 384, which is part of the total 1024. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = x\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 * (x + 1/x)^6 = 16*(x + 1/x)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(x^0\\) (the constant term) in \\((x + 1/x)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the constant term in the entire expression is 16*20 = 320. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is different. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe I'm confusing the coefficients.\n\nWait, no, because when I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but the constant term in the expression when \\(c = x\\) is 320. So, they are different things. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which includes all powers of \\(c\\), while the constant term is 320, which is just one specific term. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

To find the coefficient of this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then consider whether the second part affects this. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean we're considering the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by 6, it just scales all those coefficients. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. However, I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well.

Let me think. The expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is a constant factor. So, maybe I can consider the coefficient as 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would still be an expression in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a constant, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all variables, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be correct either. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me consider the entire expansion as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as it stands, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe the problem is in a context where \\(c\\) is treated as a constant, but that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is a constant factor, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because typically, the coefficient is a constant, not an expression. Maybe I need to check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the expansion when considering all variables, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a scalar. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve multiplying the 6 by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients of the second part, and then multiplying by the coefficient from the first part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems inconsistent with how coefficients are usually presented. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but as it stands, I have to go with what's given. Let me think again: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is treated as a constant factor, which would be incorrect because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which again is a polynomial, not a scalar. This is confusing. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. Let me recall that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what's intended. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. I think I need to clarify what exactly is being asked. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a scalar. Alternatively, if we consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient when all variables are considered, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems plausible. Let me verify that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, it's 6, but that seems too simple. Given the structure of the problem, I think the intended answer is 384. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem. For the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) does not involve \\(c\\), so its coefficient in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " That would give me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, so that part is done.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider this part as well. Maybe I should expand this part too using the binomial theorem. Let's see, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the entire original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the product of two binomial expansions. I think I need to multiply these two expansions together. But wait, actually, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. Instead, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and then multiply it by each term from the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with any term in the second expansion will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each of those. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by 1 (from the second part), but that's not correct because the second part doesn't have a constant term unless \\(c^0\\). Wait, let me clarify.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c\\) to some power, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c\\) to some power. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant, because otherwise, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. Therefore, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, is that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or could there be other terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a non-constant term, but the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out somehow? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would have some power of \\(c\\). So, the only way to have a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me terms with different powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the product will have a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Any other multiplication would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the second expansion. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when m=3, the exponent is 6 - 6 = 0, so that's correct. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion adds a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not accurate because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. So, the only term that remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply by the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because the second expansion's coefficients are tied to specific powers of \\(c\\). So, I think my initial approach was correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's different from 120. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong. Hmm, this is confusing. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients in the expansion, not just the constant term. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Then, multiplying by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's the coefficient if I'm considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term. That would make sense, and in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get 64, which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, if I multiply that by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384, which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. But that would be the case if we're considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, as I thought earlier, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the correct coefficient is 120, not 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because setting \\(c = 1\\) gives me a different answer. Maybe I need to clarify what exactly the problem is asking. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges depending on the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and any \\(c^m\\) term. But wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is specifically \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, to get that, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand the entire expression. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that's not possible because each term has a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), i.e., \\(m = 3\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then that would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's not a single term but multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and is asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times"

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which term corresponds to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what the \\(c\\) terms are. But the problem is, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms will contribute a factor that's a constant, and that constant will multiply the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, perhaps I need to compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only considering the constant term because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Hmm, that sounds complicated, but maybe I can think of it that way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like we're considering the entire expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think we just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, maybe that's not the correct approach. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, but in this case, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is indeed 64. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by each term in the other part. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by each term in the second part, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this by another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all these coefficients. So, that would be \\(6 \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of binomial coefficients from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have variables involved, the coefficients can be affected differently. But in this case, since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiple when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when variables are involved, the coefficients can be combined differently, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication is straightforward. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Each term in this expansion is multiplied by the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\n3. **Determine the contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we multiply the coefficient from the first expansion (6) by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), let me find that term specifically. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the problem is that this expression is multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so does that mean I need to consider the entire expression, or just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables c and 1/c, which are different from a and b. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c or 1/c, that means we only need the constant term (the term with c^0) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would introduce a c or 1/c, making the term have variables other than a and b. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way the resulting term doesn't have any c's is if we multiply by the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has c^0. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of c in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term with c^0 is when m = 3. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of c^0 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, and the term c^0 from the second part will contribute nothing to the a and b exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with c^0 occurs at m = 3, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To eliminate variables involving \\(c\\), we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs at \\(m = 3\\) and is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(c\\) terms will multiply with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because when I multiply, any term involving \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever coefficient comes from the \\(c\\) part when \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that would just multiply the term by 1, leaving the \\(a^2b^2\\) term as is. Wait, but actually, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider whether any of the terms from the second expansion can affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these will have a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a scalar without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in the first part is being multiplied by each term in the second part, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then actually, I need to consider that the entire \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as 6, as I found earlier. Then, for the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would indeed require multiplying 6 by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). In that case, the coefficient from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and so the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. Wait, but the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and so the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, each contributing to a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, let me confirm this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120 if considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are involved, people might only consider the term where the variables cancel out, but in this case, the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
