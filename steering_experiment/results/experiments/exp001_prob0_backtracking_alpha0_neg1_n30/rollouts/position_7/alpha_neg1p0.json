    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, that part is clear: the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think. The expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how the other part of the product affects this term. \n\nWait a second, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the entire expression is a product, but the variables are separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be 6 times something, but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut that still doesn't make much sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand each part separately, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by their respective coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), \\(c^4 \\times (1/c)^2\\), and so on, each multiplied by their coefficients.\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm supposed to collect all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and then sum their coefficients?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, as I thought earlier, is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me try another way. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's the same as before, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{5} \\times (1/c)\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{4} \\times (1/c)^2\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{0}\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the coefficient of that specific \\(c\\) term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) for each \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) term is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, if we sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, the total coefficient would be 6 * sum_{k=0 to 6} \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with the earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), then it would be different. But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\)'s power, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead considered that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times each binomial coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when summed together, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit abstract. Alternatively, since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term.\n\nIn this case, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me think, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. That means, when we multiply, the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall coefficient, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for any term will be multiplied by this 6. \n\nWait, but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two expansions, we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term will involve some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). So, unless there's a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), that term would be a constant. So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then that would be the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nSo, let me try to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and since we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be the product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, indeed, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all distinct, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficients from each binomial expansion, provided that the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second part don't interfere. Since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the only term that affects it is the constant term in the second expansion, as any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which we're not interested in. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. \n2. Identify the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). \n3. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. \n4. Find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n5. Multiply the coefficients from steps 2 and 4 to get the final coefficient: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, looking at the expansion, when \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait a second, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions and how they multiply together. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I can just take the coefficient from the first part and ignore the second part? Let me think.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), that term must come from the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't what I want. So, I need the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nAlright, so I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which has a coefficient of 6) by the constant term from the second expansion (which has a coefficient of 20), the resulting coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 as the constant term. When I multiply these together, it's 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in the binomial coefficients? Let me check \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). 4 choose 2 is 6, correct. And 6 choose 3 is 20, which is also correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. \n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire expansion. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part.

    "text": " \n\nNow, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nOkay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product of both expansions. \n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part of the product and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum over all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient depend on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and its coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each expansion. But no, actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, leading to multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) but different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the product as a whole and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let's assume that's what the problem is asking. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. Actually, \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. So, I think I must have misinterpreted the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written correctly, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part can be anything. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from some minimum to maximum exponent based on the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, that suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense because then it's a specific term. So, let's go back to that interpretation. \n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut wait, let me confirm this because I'm a bit confused. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120, which is a numerical value. So, perhaps that's what the problem intended. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the product is a polynomial, and each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which again doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a numerical value. So, I think that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical answer. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts multiplied together. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire"

So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I might need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms would have to cancel out to leave a term without any \\(c\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)). \n\nWait, let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for a term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by a term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\). Because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give me \\(c^0\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the two coefficients I found. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

But here's the thing: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression. \n\nWait a minute, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like it would change the coefficient. Wait, no, because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a separate part, and it's being multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and when you multiply by the second expansion, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would require \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = c^0 = 1\\). \n\nWait, that's an interesting point. So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWe found earlier that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20. So, multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. \n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. \n\nI think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) in the expansion where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Now, I'm a bit confused here. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), does the multiplication affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then realize that the second part will contribute a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiple for each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is also a sum of terms, so if I just multiply by the entire second part, it would actually affect the coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and all those contributions add up. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me check. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term of \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q(c)\\). So, for example, if \\(P(a, b)\\) has a term \\(T \\cdot a^2b^2\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) has a term \\(U \\cdot c^k\\), then the product will have a term \\(T \\cdot U \\cdot a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. The sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we expand the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have a coefficient that includes the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being the same as in the first part, because the second part is a separate variable and doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, effectively scaling the coefficient by the entire second expression. But since the second expression is a sum, it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let me expand both parts separately and see. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply the first expansion by the second expansion, each term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all these products, because each multiplication gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), which would make \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively evaluating the second part at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of its coefficients. Therefore, this method also confirms that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only concerned with the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since none of those terms involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Let's consider the entire product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4 \\times (1/c)^2\\), and so on. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), etc. However, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the variables (like \\(c\\)) can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms, each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum of terms, each being the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part. But no, that's not right because the variables are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms to affect it. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think of it another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each expression that multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, that seems different from my earlier conclusion.\n\nHmm, so which is correct? Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) would have coefficient 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second part, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4 \\times (1/c)^2\\) would have coefficient 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 = c^2\\), and so on. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, we can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the sum of all its coefficients is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\). In the first part, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2. The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum of its coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, according to the previous logic, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 times 2, which is 4. Let's compute the product: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), which is present in the terms \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). So, the coefficients are 2c and 2/c. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(ab\\) is present. So, the coefficient would be \\(2c + 2/c\\). But that's not a constant; it's dependent on \\(c\\). Wait, but in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific monomial. However, in this example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, in the original problem, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps the original problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 = a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 = a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), and so on. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), which is 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me check this with another approach. Let's compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider how it interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, but another way is to realize that since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific monomial, so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor of 64 (the sum of its coefficients), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and on \\(b\\) is 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the second part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.\n\nOh, right! When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that maybe the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect this coefficient because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is just \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier, and it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply by the second part, which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire term is \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient would be \\(6\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then the answer would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product, which would involve the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me recap to make sure. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't specified. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nIf it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's the latter, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where, in addition to \\(a^2b^2\\), the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would require finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), since the middle term when expanding is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(c^{6 - 3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = c^3 \\times c^{-3} = c^0 = 1\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the other variables. So, if the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems counterintuitive because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion, leading to a sum of coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make more sense as a single coefficient. Let me check the problem again: It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m (1/c)^n\\), but the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is structured such that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nSo, let me proceed under that assumption. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\)\". In algebra, when you're looking for the coefficient of a term in a product, you have to consider all variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's implying that \\(c\\) can be any power, so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a single number. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m(1/c)^n\\), but when we multiply, the exponents add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be the coefficient 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, this interpretation might not be correct because the result would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a single term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes sense because the coefficient would then be a number. So, I think this is the intended interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me write out the product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums together, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be right because the problem asks for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in the first sum, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second sum, the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\):**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times "

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) appear. So, in the expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, I think the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, actually, no, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a single term in the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, you end up with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, I think I need to consider that each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's only multiplied by the constant term in the second part, if any. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only term in the second part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of these terms will give terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, we need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term in the second expansion is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720/36 = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. But wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), then the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 20a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the previous step. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but is that all? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply by the constant term 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), then the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there's no other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could any other term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let's see. Suppose we take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), say \\(a^3b\\). Then, if we multiply it by a term from the second part that has \\(c^{-1}\\), like \\(6/c^4\\), would that affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents? No, because multiplying by \\(c^{-1}\\) doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by \\(6/c^4\\) would give \\(6a^3b/c^4\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any other term from the first part would have different exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second part, they would not result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part, as any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would change the exponents of \\(c\\) but not the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss anything. For example, could there be a case where a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with higher exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has negative exponents of \\(c\\), thereby reducing the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? But no, because when you multiply polynomials, the exponents add, but in this case, the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, so they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are solely determined by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second polynomial. Therefore, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you must take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, we need to find the term in the second part where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I think I've convinced myself multiple times that the coefficient is 120, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, looking at the general term in the expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me solve for \\(k\\): if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) is the one I want. \n\nCalculating that term, it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. That means when I multiply them out, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nIn other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and since the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, but the variables are different, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a sum, not a single term.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have two independent expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term in the product will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-6 + m})\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each term in its expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - n} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n = \\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\) where \\(m\\) is some exponent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. Therefore, when considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier, with coefficient 6. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}\\) for \\(n = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, for each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}\\) for each \\(n\\), and then we sum over all \\(n\\). But that would again give 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we can find the term where \\(6 - 2n = 0\\), which gives \\(n = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem probably expects a numerical answer.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by the second part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, without considering \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier, with coefficient 6. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by the entire second expansion. So, I think the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. The first part expands to \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part expands to \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\)\n\nWhich is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second part is only to the first power, and we don't get any \\(b^2\\) from it. So, maybe my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, but in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distr"

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check that: \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Let me think: since the two parts are multiplied together, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients multiply only if you're looking for specific terms. But in this case, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part won't be affected by the second part because they don't share the same variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms in the second expansion will just be constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication by the second expansion will just scale that term by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, I think that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expansion. Wait, no, because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would require evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve terms from both expansions. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, another approach: when you have two independent variables, the coefficients in the product are the products of the coefficients from each part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me check that logic again. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(P(a, b)\\), it will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables as separate. But since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, including those multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would still be 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in the coefficient being a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me try to think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum over all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that logic again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\cdot (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first part is 2. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\((1 + 1) = 2\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's check that by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1) = a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), it's 4, which matches 2 * 2 = 4. So, that works. Therefore, my approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. Let me think about another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\cdot (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first part is 0 because it's only to the first power. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 0 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 0. That makes sense because there is no \\(ab\\) term in \\((a + b)^1\\).\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\cdot (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first part is 3. The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient"

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all the terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually involve the sum over all the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps that's the right approach.\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so the final coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThen, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that constant term is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only when \\(c^0\\) is involved, so the constant term.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term when \\(k=2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. Hmm, does that mean I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on that specific term from the first expansion and see how it interacts with the second expansion. \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. If I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left( \\text{something} \\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will have the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), where \"something\" is a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but no, that's not correct either because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion. But since the entire expression is a product of two expansions, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply a term by a sum, the coefficient of that term in the product is the coefficient of the term times the sum of the coefficients of the other part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Wait, that's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the product, each term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a sum, it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I consider \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables independent of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nWait, that makes sense too. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, let's calculate that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is zero. Let's find that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, and now I'm getting 120. That's a big difference. So, which one is correct? \n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? \n\nWait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's referring to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier. But when I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I got 120. So, which interpretation is correct? \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), where \"something\" is a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, when I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I got 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). \n\nBut if I expand it, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The term \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\) both have \\(a^1b^0\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, adding up to 2. So, that matches. \n\nSimilarly, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\), that would be 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) would be 1. But if I'm just looking for \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2. \n\nTherefore, in the original problem, since it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the answer should"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how this second part affects the coefficient. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, they are separate variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from the first part (involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) will be multiplied by the terms from the second part (involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the entire second part can be considered as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, let me think. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the answer is just 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering any powers of \\(c\\), perhaps we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be right because each term in the second part has different coefficients, so the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem correct either because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is in the second part, it's separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the variables in one part are independent of the other. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that we treat \\(c\\) as another variable and consider the entire expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that might make sense. Let me check.\n\nSo, if I consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if I multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But wait, is that the correct approach? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering all variables, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-express the problem. Let me write the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the term in the first expansion. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that approach might be wrong because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the corresponding term in the first expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, let's approach it that way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, that's the constant term, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, assuming we're considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Looking at the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Hmm, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) of the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients are independent. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means I need to find all terms in the expansion where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient will be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would give me a very large coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps they mean the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with coefficients that are polynomials in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might just be expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased is just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and they just want the coefficient when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe I should think that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2. Then, when I multiply this by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe they want the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so that would involve finding the term where in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the power of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, the constant term. Because then, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, in that case, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean they want the coefficient treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 64, giving 384? Or do they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they mean the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if they just want the coefficient as a number, perhaps they mean the sum of coefficients, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, maybe they just want the coefficient treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe they just want the coefficient as 6, but that seems incorrect because the second part is a separate polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up similar problems. Typically, when you have a product of two polynomials and you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in the product, you have to consider the terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part will multiply it, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. So, perhaps that's the answer they're looking for.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, so 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, so if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased in a way that it's expecting me to realize that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps they mean the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But again, that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, I think I should go with that. Because otherwise, the problem is ambiguous. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So"

So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions. But hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

But since the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Or do I have to multiply it by something else?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't include \\(c\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only has powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected by the second expansion in terms of the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a product of two expansions. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), \\(c^4 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of the products of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in the second expansion that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're treating the entire expression as a single polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, because the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which is just 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for the product of specific terms. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. \n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I might just need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply each term by the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms that are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we are only concerned with the part that comes from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) expansion, and the \\(c\\) part just gets multiplied as a whole, but since it's not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when you expand the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the \\(c\\) expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. \n\nBut wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part isn't a single number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the second part suggests that it's more involved. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the second part is a separate polynomial, and when multiplied, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in each term of the product, but the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I need to look at it differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that when you multiply out everything, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times 64, as before, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this will be a product of two polynomials. Each term in the product will be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, say, \\(C\\), and the variable part will be \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the entire term in the product will be \\(6 \\times C \\times a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6 \\times C \\times a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients \\(6 \\times C_k\\), where \\(C_k\\) is the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients in that expansion. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might have specific powers of \\(c\\) that are being considered, but since it's not specified, I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, then perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from one is multiplied by each term from the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, it's likely that it's considering the entire expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the \\(c\\) terms, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(c^0 = 1\\). In that case, we would need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's unclear. However, since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each with their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nYes, that seems right. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Let's consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the resulting term in the product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSince \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nI think I've convinced myself that the answer is 384. So, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{384}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^"

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we don't need to consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear there.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expansion.

But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second expansion will just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, the second part doesn't affect their exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6=64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because I might be misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the product without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the product includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have the form \\(6 \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check by actually expanding a bit. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64 + \\text{other terms}\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 64c^0\\) is part of the product, but also \\(6a^2b^2 * \\text{other terms}\\) will contribute to other terms in the product. But when we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), since the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps I need to clarify. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire product includes the second expansion. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) (assuming \\(b^0\\)) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second). Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, if I set \\(a^1b^0\\), the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nHmm, now I'm really confused. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the coefficients work. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) remains the same when multiplied by Q(c), because Q(c) doesn't involve a or b. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and when multiplied by Q(c), each term in Q(c) multiplies the entire P(a, b). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). Since the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is when c=1, which is 2^6=64, so 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. But if we consider the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\("

In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have another binomial expansion multiplied by this first expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first expansion, but the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) terms. In other words, we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied.\n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but also have \\(c\\) raised to some power. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we don't need to consider other terms because they would change the variables involved. So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first expansion, we only need to consider how it's multiplied by the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\). Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\), that would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't what we want. We just want \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to multiply it by the constant term, which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are independent, their product will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) to find \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term from the second part is 20.\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But that seems incorrect because the second expansion isn't a single term, it's multiple terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of two expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part.

The second part's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I think that's not the case because \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I think that's the right approach.\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that would result in a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so the combined term is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense either because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, so treating both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a bit strange because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a multiplier, so the coefficient is 6 times that expression. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so if the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6.\n\nWait, that seems more likely. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6. But let me check that. Let me think of it as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient, treating all variables as part of the same expression, then it's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\), and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that's not correct because for each \\(k\\) and \\(m\\), you have a term, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only dependent on \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a misstatement, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nOkay, let's try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, and considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the answer would be 120. Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product when considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient when the product is expanded, and specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient when considering the entire product, we also need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which term corresponds to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Now, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, provided that the variables don't interfere. So, in other words, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part might contribute a factor that could change the coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion, and since all those terms are separate, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me check. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it's not a scalar, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but perhaps we're just supposed to find the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating all variables as separate. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the problem is only concerned with the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the corresponding power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's scaled by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients are multiplied, but each term is separate.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial would scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables with 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's not correct because the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), which gives terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2(1/c)\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab(1/c)\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2(1/c)\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the product doesn't have a term where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared simultaneously with \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1}\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2. So, 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, so that means that my approach is incorrect. The problem is that when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the first polynomial provides exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second polynomial provides a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is any term. Wait, but that's not possible because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial. Wait, but in my example, the first polynomial was \\((a + b)^2\\), which does have a \\(2ab\\) term, but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, so in our original problem, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term with coefficient 6. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, or maybe just the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there was no such term. So, in our problem, since the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But in the example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so maybe that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for that. But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the example, that approach failed because it gave a non-zero answer when the actual coefficient was zero. So, perhaps that's not the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times 6, because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, this approach didn't work because the first polynomial didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Let me see, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is not just about \\((a + b)^4\\), it's the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how these two parts interact. \n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The entire expression is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product. \n\nWait a second, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables in \\(P\\), while \\(c\\) is a variable in \\(Q\\). So, when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for all terms in the product where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can think of this as the coefficient being the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If we have \\(P = \\text{something}\\) and \\(Q = \\text{something else}\\), then when we multiply them, each term in \\(P\\) multiplies each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains, and the coefficients add up. \n\nBut wait, does that make sense? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose \\(P = a + b\\) and \\(Q = c + 1/c\\). Then \\(P \\times Q = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), right? So, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But in this case, \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. So, maybe my initial thought isn't correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, so when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nBut how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) would be 6 (from \\(P\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. So, when I have \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2 c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2 c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2 c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2 c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then we can factor out \\(a^2b^2\\) and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(Q\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient from \\(P\\) is 6, as I found earlier, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let me actually compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand \\(Q\\), it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. Therefore, the sum of coefficients is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier. \n\nTherefore, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that accurate? Because when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) it's 6 * 6 = 36, for \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) it's 6 * 15 = 90, for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) it's 6 * 20 = 120, for \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) it's 6 * 15 = 90, for \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) it's 6 * 6 = 36, and for \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) it's 6 * 1 = 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I need to sum all these coefficients. So, adding them up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: \n\n6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. \n\nSo, that confirms it: the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficients from \\(Q\\). Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). \n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. \n\nSo, when I multiply each of these by 6 (the coefficient from \\(P\\)), I get 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, 6. Adding these together gives 384, as I did before. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nBut let me just think again: is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering generating functions or something else? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the product in another way. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): \n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem: \n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\frac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the powers \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6 \\times 1 a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all these coefficients. So, adding up 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 gives 384, as before. \n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384. \n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident with this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4!/(2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another term: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think about how these two parts interact.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the multiplication won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so actually, the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Hmm, but wait, that might not be right either.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has many terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms are just multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, making it 384. Wait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but the entire product includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, indeed, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), because Q(c) doesn't involve a or b. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Since Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when c=1, which is 2^6=64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, the only way to have a numerical coefficient is to sum all the coefficients from Q(c), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have products, the coefficients can be multiplied differently. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can look at it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve a or b. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, we need to consider that the second part contributes a factor that is the sum of its coefficients, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the c terms don't affect the a and b exponents. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a single number, perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^1b^0 would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is c + 1/c. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of a^1b^0, regardless of c, it would be 1*(1) because when c=1, the second part is 2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in this case, the coefficient of a^1b^0 is 1, and the coefficient of a^0b^1 is 1 as well. But when multiplied by (c + 1/c), each of these would be multiplied by (c + 1/c). So, the term a^1b^0 would become a*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of a would be (c + 1/c), which isn't a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of the entire expression, meaning that the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, but that's an expression, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. But that seems contradictory because the problem is written as a single product, so the coefficient should account for the entire expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any power of c. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since it's asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, making it 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. When you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, it's actually 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. But that seems inconsistent because the second part is part of the product, so it should affect the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the intended answer is 384. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a would be 1*(c + 1/c), which is c + 1/c, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. But that seems contradictory because the problem is written as a product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients is found by substituting c = 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials P and Q, then the coefficient of a specific term in P * Q is the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the specific term's coefficient in P is multiplied by the entire Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q). Since the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, the answer is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in this expansion. Let me think about what \\(k\\) would be in this case. Since \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is the general term, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiply with any terms from the second part? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second part. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), but if I multiply it by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which I don't want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the exponents add up. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) from the second part, that would be \\(a^2b^2c^{k - (6 - k)} = a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the term where \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), that's when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which equals 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the constant term, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Let me think. If I have, say, \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term with \\(1/c\\), that would give \\(a^3b \\times 1/c\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\), so it doesn't contribute. Similarly, \\(ab^3\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) would give \\(ab^3c\\), which is also not \\(a^2b^2\\). Only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term would give \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think my reasoning is correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe are looking for the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Or do I have to consider all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear when multiplied by terms from the second expression? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nSince we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply them by \\(a^2b^2\\), they just add a factor that's a term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other factors (involving \\(c\\)) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the overall expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut let me check that. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{i} \\text{Term}_i \\times \\sum_{j} \\text{Term}_j\\), where each \\(\\text{Term}_i\\) is a term from \\(A\\) and each \\(\\text{Term}_j\\) is a term from \\(B\\). So, when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all products where \\(\\text{Term}_i\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\text{Term}_j\\) is any term from \\(B\\). \n\nBut since \\(\\text{Term}_i\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, the coefficient from \\(A\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and then when we multiply by each term in \\(B\\), each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is only present when multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\), right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get terms involving \\(c\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only term in \\(B\\) that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the constant term in \\(B\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I only need to consider the constant term in \\(B\\), because any other term in \\(B\\) would introduce a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(B\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nEarlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to this, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Expanding using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), does that mean that when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, no, I think I need to be careful here. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part? Because the constant term is the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) combine to give a constant, which is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me confirm that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you would end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) which is 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part contributes a constant, the product term will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, yeah, the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients. Since the variables in the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match, but since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's just 6 times 20. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, looking at the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). If I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only in the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second part. But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of both expansions. So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider how it's multiplied by terms from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiplier for each term in the first expansion. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the expansion of the second part? Wait, no, because the second part is also being expanded, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear there, it's just a scalar multiple. So, actually, the entire coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the second expansion. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is being multiplied as a whole. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part. But that seems too simple. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe I'm correct because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second expansion just act as coefficients for the terms in the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, the corresponding term in the second expansion would have to be \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, which would change the variables involved. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Ah, that makes sense. So, I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6.\n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I realized that in the product, this term would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by all terms from the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the variables. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.
