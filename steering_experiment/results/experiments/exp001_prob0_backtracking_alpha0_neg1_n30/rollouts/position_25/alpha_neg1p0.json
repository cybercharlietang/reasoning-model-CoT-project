Alternatively, I could think of the entire product as a product of two generating functions, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's sufficient to consider the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.

So, when we multiply these together, we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part.

    "text": " \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to find all terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But the only way that can happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term \\(c^0\\), because if it's any other term, say \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself. So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, let's tackle that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, expanding this, we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\). So, combining the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just verify each step again. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: yes, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0 gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nWait a second, but hold on. Let me think again about how the multiplication works. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But only the constant term in the second polynomial will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^0\\), which is 1, and then the terms start with negative exponents as we go further. So, the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.

The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that reasoning. Because when you have two separate expansions, the overall coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each expansion corresponding to the terms that, when multiplied together, give you the desired term.
