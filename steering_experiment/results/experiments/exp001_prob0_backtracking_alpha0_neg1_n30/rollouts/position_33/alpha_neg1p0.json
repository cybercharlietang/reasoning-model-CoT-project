First, I correctly identified that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\(k=2\\) term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which gave me 6.

Multiplying these together gives 120, which seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors because 6 choose 2 is 15? Wait, hold on. Wait, no, 4 choose 2 is 6, right? Because 4 factorial is 24, divided by 2 factorial squared, which is 4, so 24 / 4 is 6. That's correct. And 6 choose 3 is 20, yes, because 6 factorial is 720, divided by 3 factorial squared, which is 36, so 720 / 36 is 20. So, that's correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

    "text": " So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0, because that's \\(c^0\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and correctly identified the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I set up the binomial expansion and correctly found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).
