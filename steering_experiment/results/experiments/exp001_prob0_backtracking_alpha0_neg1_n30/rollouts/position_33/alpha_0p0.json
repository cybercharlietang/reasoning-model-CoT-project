So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. The coefficients multiply, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated, which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Did I make any mistakes in my reasoning? Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in that reasoning.

That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will only contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term we're interested in. So, yes, only the constant term from the second part matters here. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).
