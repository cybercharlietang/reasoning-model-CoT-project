Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. Then, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem and found that the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, but wait, is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. Any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the variables involved, so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The first part has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), and the second part has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. When I multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I must take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense. I don't think I missed anything here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. The coefficients multiply when you take terms from each expansion that don't interfere with each other's variables. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, again, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply each term in the second. But only the constant term in the second will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).
