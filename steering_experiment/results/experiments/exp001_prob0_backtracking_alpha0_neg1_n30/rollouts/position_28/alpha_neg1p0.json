So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6) and the \\(c^0\\) term (which is 20), and all other products would involve \\(c\\) terms, which we're not interested in. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.

Let me just recap: The binomial coefficients for each part were calculated correctly, and since the terms we're interested in don't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is the coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, I need to multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the product have a \\(c\\) term. So, that makes sense. So, I only need to consider the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider whether there's any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). Suppose I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^m\\). Then, when I multiply them, I would get \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\). For this to be \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), which is as before. But then, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(m\\). But since we're looking for the term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(m = 0\\), which again brings us back to the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), then the product is the sum over all k and m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) for the \\(c\\) term. So, as before, \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6 choose 3 is 20, yes, because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 120/6 = 20. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when I multiply these together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^0\\), which we already found to have a coefficient of 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion. Let me see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, that's the term we're interested in. There are no other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if there's any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could, when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, suppose I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by \\(c^k\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, that's only when \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. So, that's the only contribution, and that's why we only consider the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, after going through all these steps and double-checking, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"
