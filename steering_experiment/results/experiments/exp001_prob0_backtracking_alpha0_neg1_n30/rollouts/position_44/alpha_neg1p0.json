The coefficient for this term is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. Alternatively, to confirm, maybe I can think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier. And for the \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of it another way. Suppose I consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that will multiply it without introducing \\(c\\) terms is the constant term, which is when the exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^3 \\times c^{-3} = c^0\\). So, that term is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is 20. So, again, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Okay, I think that's solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms only in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only care about the term in the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\). So, again, that's 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me check if there's any possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms in the second polynomial. For example, could a term with \\(c\\) in the second polynomial somehow combine with a term in the first polynomial to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is purely in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and any term from the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, only the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I've thought through this thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial, because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, right? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of a term from each polynomial. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) they have. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can come from any term in the second polynomial, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that contradicts my earlier approach where I thought only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes. So, which approach is correct? Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomials, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it usually refers to the coefficient of that term regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high, and I might be misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, and the answer would be 120. Let me try to resolve this ambiguity. In standard polynomial terminology, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific monomial, like \\(a^2b^2\\), it usually means the coefficient of that exact monomial, regardless of other variables. However, in this case, the expression involves multiple variables, and the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger expression that includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a very large coefficient, and I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the entire product. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 20c^0 + \\text{other terms}\\), then when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 120. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Now, we also need to consider the exponent of \\(c\\), which is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(m\\) such that \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is the coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), it gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems contradictory to my earlier conclusion. So, which is it? Let me clarify: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem statement is a bit ambiguous, but in most cases, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials with multiple variables, it's usually referring to the coefficient of that exact monomial, meaning all variables are specified. So, in this case, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\)\", that would be clear. But since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of the problem, since \\(c\\) is another variable, it's likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything here. Let me try to compute the product step by step. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms where each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a constant, but in reality, the product would have terms like \\(384a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that's not a single number, it's a polynomial. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think I was right the first time. The answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about this again. Suppose I have two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. When I multiply them, P(a, b) * Q(c) = (a + b)^4 * (c + 1/c)^6. So, the product is a polynomial in a, b, and c. Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be the sum of all terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponent of c. So, each such term would be of the form 6a^2b^2 multiplied by some coefficient from Q(c) times c^k. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). But the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the correct answer. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is it? Let me see. If I set c = 1 in Q(c), I get the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 64. Therefore, when I multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think I was wrong earlier. The correct answer is 384. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of c. So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. Therefore, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I have two different interpretations leading to two different answers. Let me try to clarify once and for all. The key is to understand what the problem"

Alternatively, I could think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.
