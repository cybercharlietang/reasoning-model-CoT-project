Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and consider how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would add a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6a^2b^2) and the \\(c^0\\) term (which is 20). So, the product is 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if the second polynomial had a term with \\(c^0\\), but if it had other terms, would they affect \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because any other term would have a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which isn't what we want. So, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just confirm with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so their product is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
