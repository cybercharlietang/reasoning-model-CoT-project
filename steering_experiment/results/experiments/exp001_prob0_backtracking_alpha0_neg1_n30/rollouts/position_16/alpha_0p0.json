    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to find the entire expansion and then multiply the coefficients? Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just be multiplied by the 6 we found earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of whatever term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The expression is a product of two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because we're just looking for the coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, perhaps the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. But wait, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is a finite expansion, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be, because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents as well as \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems a bit odd because \\(c\\) is separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying 6 by 20, giving 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe. Let me think. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can treat the other part as a constant when considering just \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be any term, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the other expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\). So perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. Each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both expressions and multiply the terms, but that seems tedious. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, meaning the constant term. Let me think. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, I'm a bit confused because the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when it asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it might be considering all possible terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's the former case, where the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, yes, that seems to align with the idea that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120.

Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) each of those terms, but that's not a single coefficient. Wait, no, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\), and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple, and I might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to realize that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^4b^0 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^3b^1 \\times c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^2\\), etc., all the way down to \\(a^0b^4 \\times 1/c^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from each part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions. The first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require knowing the power of \\(c\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to verify this. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the sum of coefficients or just the coefficient in the product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying 6 by each term in the second expansion, leading to multiple coefficients for different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a number. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's considering all possible coefficients, which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second polynomial is irrelevant. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about it another way. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c +"

Wait, but actually, no, because each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part is about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me clarify: The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are separate variables. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), because every term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is just Q(1), right? Because if you substitute c = 1, you get the sum of coefficients. So, let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of its coefficients by substituting c = 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is a polynomial in c, and when multiplied by the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which is a power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the variables a and b, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a separate variable, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which includes all the terms from both expansions. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me first compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), I get that \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the entire product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each m. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, as I thought earlier. So, substituting c = 1, we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the a and b terms, so the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which includes all terms. So, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by 64 (the sum of its coefficients), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.

Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{6 - m}\\), depending on the expansion.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms would be the product of the coefficients.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of that term's coefficient and the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first expansion, so its coefficient in the product would be the coefficient in the first expansion times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) and \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when I multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, I think that means we're supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum up the coefficients for each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all possible powers of \\(c\\) when multiplied, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(64\\) (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the variables are different. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're supposed to find a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading it. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't seem right for a coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would require me to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That sounds more plausible. So, let me proceed with that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) in the entire product is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I was correct the first time, but then the problem would be asking for a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), so when I expand everything, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120.

So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the term where the second part contributes a constant. So, yes, it's 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I think the problem is more involved than that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is indeed 6.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\).

So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that it's the coefficient when you multiply both expansions together. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is indeed 6. Let me check online or think about similar problems. I recall that when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable is independent of the other. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. So, maybe the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to write out the product more carefully. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nWhen you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all these coefficients for each power of \\(c\\). But that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 6.

So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make sense. So, if I think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the other part). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient isn't just a number, but an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is equal to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms affect the overall expression? Let me think. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) can be treated separately. Because when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the 6. But wait, no, that might not be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms combine. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), they are independent variables. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-n})\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would still be 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, set \\(c = 1\\), giving 64.

The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64.

    "text": " Does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part evaluated at the relevant terms? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, you might get other terms involving \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. Wait, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term in the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, it would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would imply that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other exponent would give a term with \\(c\\) which we don't want. So, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second expansion at \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the term in the second expansion that is a constant is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term from the second expansion (which has coefficient 20), we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 when \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, multiplying those together gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents don't affect \\(c\\).

So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. But that seems unlikely because the expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check my reasoning. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That means I might not need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the entire coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but only considering the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one gets multiplied by each term in the other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a huge number, which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) terms must cancel out to give a constant term. Because otherwise, if we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a different approach. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, if I'm correct, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then we're only considering the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, leaving just the constant term. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered that in the product with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, I calculated the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as 20. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Set the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) part can be treated separately, and since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part would just be 1, right? Wait, no, actually, no.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if you don't specify, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all the terms from the second expression, but that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can consider the product as a product of two independent expansions and just take the coefficient from the first part. But that seems too simplistic because the second part is also expanded. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of products of coefficients from each part. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make sense because then you'd have a specific term. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. If that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. The problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c^0\\). Let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then that coefficient would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignore the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, but each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe implying that \\(c\\) terms are not considered. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the product is a combination of both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms that add up to \\(2^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion (which includes terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\)) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion (which includes terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a sum over all possible terms from the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would have a numerical coefficient. So, let me try that approach. So, first, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give us \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm assuming something that's not there. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my calculations. From the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That suggests that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression. Wait, does that mean we're considering the entire product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would just be the sum of the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that would be the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it a different term. Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are considering the coefficient in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expression, which does involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second expression has a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, that would mean I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the constant term in the second part is 20, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the constant term from the second part would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (the constant term). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, in other words, in the expansion of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right either because each term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the same as 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term from the second part). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean that I have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is the product of the two coefficients: 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) involved. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, then multiply them together to get 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem, found coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Correct.\n\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the term where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\n3. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to consider all terms where the product of the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first expansion, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve considering how the terms combine. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems plausible. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, in which case the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, because \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are separate variables, so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part's expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's separate. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to realize that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then multiply the terms, but that would take too long. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6*64=384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check my reasoning again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I had to write out the entire expansion, it would be tedious, but this approach seems logical.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I have to consider the entire expansion? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think that means when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or perhaps the second part contributes a constant term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. Let me check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other term involving \\(c\\) would change the term, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the constant term in a binomial expansion like this? I remember that in the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly. Then, I realized that to get the coefficient in the entire expression, I need to multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I found the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me \\(k = 3\\), and then I calculated \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) correctly as 20. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, so I think that's the right answer. I don't think I missed anything here because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, yeah, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means I might not need to consider the entire expansion of the second part because I'm only interested in the terms that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I expand both parts and multiply them together, the terms will combine. But I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. However, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. So, actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would imply that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out to a constant term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of that. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, so unless the term in the second expansion is a constant term, those terms would not contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a sum of terms, each of which is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the expansion where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part can be any term from its expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and each term from the second part. But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), and the second part has terms with \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms, which would make it a different term. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m \\). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me clarify. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when you multiply this by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), the product will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That is, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, each term is a product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, unless \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the term will have \\(c\\) in it, and thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), because that's the only term where \\(c\\) doesn't appear, making it a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply a term by a polynomial, the coefficient of that term in the product is the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the answer should be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Let me just confirm this with another approach. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(Q(c)\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if I consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), then in the product, it's just \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because the exponents of \\(c\\) don't interfere with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the exponents of different variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply, you're combining each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Let me clarify. When you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when taking the product. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider all possible terms from the second expression multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no. Wait, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, A and B. A is \\((a + b)^4\\), and B is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product A * B will have terms where each term from A is multiplied by each term from B. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from A will be multiplied by each term in B, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from B, because each term in B is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in B). The sum of coefficients in B is when \\(c = 1\\), so B becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider if the terms interact differently, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents are independent. So, I think this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), its coefficient is effectively 1 for all terms. Wait, no, that's not right. The second part has coefficients for different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yeah, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I thought earlier, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me calculate \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and confirm the sum of coefficients. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient becomes the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That suggests that I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms could influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients? Hmm, no, because they are separate variables. So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients for each variable part are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will remain 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a product of two expansions. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms in each expansion don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps we need to consider the entire expression. Wait, no, the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't be. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing something. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any consideration for \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\) because of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, but let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but only looking at the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a constant; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but without considering \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied together. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting interpretations here. Let me try to clarify the problem statement again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m c^{-n}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, as I calculated earlier, is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. Wait, no, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this polynomial. However, that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is a red herring. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a multiplier that affects other terms but not the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term from the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, which doesn't seem right for the problem's phrasing. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's break it down. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would give a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's equivalent to saying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not a standard way to phrase it. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you have to specify all the variables and their exponents. Since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. However, given the problem's phrasing, it's likely that the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a multiplier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or maybe I do need to consider some interaction? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be coefficients multiplied by that term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, the second part can be considered as a constant multiplier for that term. Wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's just the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and whatever term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the constant term (if any) from the second part that would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then that term would just contribute a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, you're considering all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe I do because the entire expression is multiplied together. Wait, actually, no.

So, when I multiply these two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second part.

So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Wait, that seems too easy. Let me think again. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when I expand both, I have to consider the product of each term from the first expansion and each term from the second expansion.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But is that correct? Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would include all the terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each term in the second expansion is a term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so effectively, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But that's not correct because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

So, maybe the entire coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if I have a constant term, then when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as part of the same term. Alternatively, if there's a non-constant term, it would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient. Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire expression is a product of two expansions.

Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part has a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these two parts together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), 4 choose 2 is indeed 6. And for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, right? So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 6*20=120. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I think about expanding both expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, and all other terms would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from that specific term, which is 6*20=120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by calculating the product of the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), it's just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Because when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, so how does that affect the coefficient? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're not considering any specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that term would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check: the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling each term by that expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But since we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's considering all possible powers, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the product includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) term, which would affect the coefficients by scaling them. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient isn't just a single number; it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's looking for a numerical coefficient, possibly considering all terms, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), you're multiplying by every term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire product would have each term scaled by the second expansion. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply by a polynomial, each term is scaled by the entire expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's considering all possible powers, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part at all. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes that part in the expression. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try to compute the product step by step. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in this expansion, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."
