    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which is when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) equals \\(a^2b^2\\). So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. Does the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect this coefficient? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\), unless I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, but maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second part. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the second part, when expanded, would contribute a factor that's multiplied by each term in the first part, but since we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part would just contribute a factor of 1 when considering the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So perhaps the answer is just 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a very large number, and the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any term in \\(c\\). It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's just 6, because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6; it's 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient depend on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me make sure. Let's expand both parts. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with various coefficients. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, \\dots, 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\) from -6 to 6 would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms? Or is there a misunderstanding?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because for each \\(c\\) term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times that \\(c\\) term's coefficient. But since the problem isn't specifying any particular \\(c\\) term, maybe the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that's the case. The presence of the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which might not be the same as the general case. Wait, but the problem isn't evaluating at any specific \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient in the product. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is 6, as I originally thought.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m / c^n\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only looking at terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, for each term in the first part, the coefficient is multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that would be the answer.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first polynomial, and since the second polynomial is multiplied in full, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to see if this logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the first expansion. Wait, but that's a bad example because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Let me take another example where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Let's say \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, 6 * 2 = 12. If I expand it, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), so each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c\\) is 6 and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c\\) is also 6. So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c\\), it would be 6, and similarly for \\(a^2b^2/c\\). But if it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 + 6 = 12, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and in the second polynomial, we have terms involving \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient an expression, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would just be 6. But given the previous example I did, where the coefficient became 12 when considering the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are separate. Therefore, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- For \\(c^6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- For \\(c^4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- For \\(c^2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- For \\(c^0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- For \\(c^{-2}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- For \\(c^{-4}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- For \\(c^{-6}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs in this expansion. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the product is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a number, and the expansion of the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two separate binomials. So, when you multiply them out, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But actually, the coefficients in the second expression aren't being summed; instead, each term is multiplied by the corresponding term in the first expression. Wait, no, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right, because the second part is being multiplied, so the entire expression is a product, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely. Let me re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is being multiplied as a whole. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not quite right either because each term in the second part is multiplied by 6, but the coefficients in the second part are separate. Wait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Let me test this idea. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which means the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). The sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) are each multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part. Therefore, applying this logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if that's the case, then we have to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term in \\(c\\) that gives \\(c^0\\). Let me check that possibility. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then we have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem as stated says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's 384. But I'm a bit confused because the presence of \\(c\\) might mean that the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of the respective terms. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But just to make sure, let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand the entire expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(c\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm torn between 384 and 120. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But to be absolutely sure, let me consider another approach. Let me denote \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem doesn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient in the context of the entire expression, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, now I'm more confident that the answer is 120. Let me confirm this with the smaller example again. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 0 because there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, that's not right. \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 0. But if I instead look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, giving 2. But in this case, the problem is about \\(a^2"

So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the problem is asking for a specific term, but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in each product, multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would imply that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if there are any \\(c\\) terms, then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term would have a non-zero power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which isn't what we're looking for. Therefore, only the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (the entire second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient as a numerical factor, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just multiplied as a scalar. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a term in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term in }c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the same. Wait, but that can't be because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the terms in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times 2^6, since each term in the expansion has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion.

But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this will be a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), and each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\) which simplifies to \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, when we multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. I'm really confused here. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials. So, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the coefficients of terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems incorrect because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial. Wait, no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but when you multiply it by the first part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. The coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the expansion of this second part as well. But wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Let me think. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product of the two expansions, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the first part has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and then the entire second expansion is just a scalar multiple, right? Wait, no, not exactly. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then include terms with \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can treat the expression as a product of two separate expansions and focus only on the coefficients of the terms we're interested in. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion? Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is not correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the power of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then we would need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused because the problem statement doesn't specify whether it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically when the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, that seems a bit odd because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered in the context of all variables. Wait, no, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that exists in the product regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(a^0b^1\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a numerical coefficient. But in our case, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the variables are meant to be treated separately. Wait, but in the original problem, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider if the term is present in the product. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think 384 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is there something else I need to consider? Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a numerical value. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply 6 by the constant term, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me check that logic. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the powers of \\(c\\), that becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that would require more work. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since the other part involves \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a number, not a polynomial. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) part is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would involve the entire expansion of the second part. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem correct because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by the entire expression. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined solely by the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. I'm going to check this by considering the entire product.\n\nWait, another approach: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables with 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms don't overlap. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient as a number, not a polynomial, we take the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, and multiply by 6, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we only need to consider the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the other part will just be a constant multiplier. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, involving \\(c\\), would just be a factor that gets multiplied by the coefficient. So, if I think about it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too big. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering the entire expression. Hmm, but the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider how they interact.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we're just looking for how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Wait, but that can't be because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Wait, that might make sense.\n\nLet me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from that expansion will be multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), which isn't specified.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number, but rather an expression involving \\(c\\). That doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical factors. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 120. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n3. To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1)^6\\), but no, it's definitely \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem likely because the problem just asks for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, I have to consider the expansion of the second part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum all those contributions. \n\nWait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times each of those coefficients, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to a term like \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for some exponent \\(k\\), but the coefficient for each such term is \\(6\\) times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, if we are to collect all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\), then the total coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's essentially treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a single term and considering all possible powers of \\(c\\) that come along with it. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded as a sum of terms each with coefficients and powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach to make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product step by step. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as each binomial coefficient sums to \\(2^n\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nNo, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but the variables multiply as well. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), when you multiply them, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or maybe it's just the coefficient when multiplied by the entire second expression? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear in the product if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only has terms in \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6*20 is 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in multiple variables and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it must be multiplied by some term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would only occur if multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I think my initial approach is correct. \n\nLet me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6*20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think there's any other term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) would be a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and each term in the second part. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think carefully. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, but that can't be right because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, doesn't contain any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second part would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because that's how we find the sum of coefficients. So, let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my reasoning. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's equal to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, the constant term from the second part is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything. The key was realizing that since we're only looking for the term without \\(c\\), we only needed the constant term from the second part, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. That makes sense because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply as well. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that makes sense. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier as 6, and then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but without considering \\(c\\), which is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that would be a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is irrelevant because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). But that seems incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would still result in a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but it doesn't specify. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written differently. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is multiplied by all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But does that make sense? Because when \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 64, so the entire expression is 64*(a + b)^4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6*64 = 384. But wait, is this the correct approach? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression, not when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps this approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the first part, the coefficient is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when I multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient should account for the multiplication. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but then the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then recognize that the second part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should be multiplied. \n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me calculate the binomial coefficient for \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think that's 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what the coefficients are in the second part because those will only affect the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should check if there's any interaction between the two expansions that affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But no, because the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part could have some constants or other terms that might affect the coefficient. But no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but none of these affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and it's multiplied by whatever comes from the second expansion, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, regardless of the value of \\(m\\), because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, so the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms would be from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just 6. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. But no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6. Because when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient doesn't change. It's as if you're multiplying by a constant, but actually, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is still 6. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6\\) when you set \\(c = 1\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. \n\nWait, no, that approach is wrong because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but it's not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression but don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain the same as in the first polynomial, and the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression but don't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a single expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and sum their coefficients. But since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, each term in the expansion would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems contradictory to my earlier thought. So, which is it? Is the coefficient 6 or 384? Let me check. \n\nIf I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it was just 6. So, which is it? Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you expand the entire expression, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nTo find that, we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have terms where \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is the coefficient for each \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nSo, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to make sure. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which would be 2 if we set \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is just 1, because each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. When you expand, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a number. So, the coefficient isn't a number unless you evaluate it at specific values. \n\nWait, so maybe in that small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which might be interpreted as the numerical coefficient,"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, maybe all the terms from the second expansion will just contribute a factor that is multiplied by 6, and since we're only concerned with the a and b parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right either because the second expansion has terms with different powers of c, and each of those would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, but when you sum them, it's \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and has a coefficient of 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for because it's possible that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so maybe it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, including those with c. But then, in that case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is just another factor, so maybe the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the product includes terms with c, so each term in the product would be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^2b^2c^k, where k is some exponent. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, maybe we just need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, to get the total coefficient, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible c terms. But that wouldn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without c, so it can't be combined with terms that have c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is zero. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since the second expansion has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20, then when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has coefficient 6, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would give the coefficient if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, but in reality, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c. But if the problem is in the entire product, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion because any other term would have a power of c, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms in the product where the power of a is 2 and the power of b is 2. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve c, so when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any c. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (c^0) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about summing all the coefficients, but that was incorrect because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any c terms. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of c is zero). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting 6 - 2k = 0 gives k = 3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nThen, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of c cancel out. As I calculated, that's when k = 3, giving the term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a c term, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only affected by the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). When I expand \\(A \\times B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), which includes different powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that seems too broad because \\(B\\) has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But in reality, the variables are separate. So, in the product, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are from the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are from the second part. So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(B\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you have the product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient in the first expression multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the variables are separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't just a single number, but rather a sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies a single numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. But the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this. Let me think about how the product works. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 64\\) would be part of the product, but actually, it's more accurate to say that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part, and multiply them. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Or is it just the first part that's relevant here? Hmm, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's only about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many times that term appears when multiplying by the second expansion. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion, it's going to create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), depending on the term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any other terms involving \\(c\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and I multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's only possible if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, unless there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because when you multiply, you need to have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term to get just \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, it's multiplied by some \\(c\\) term, which would give a different term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. Let me check that. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). When we multiply these, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first by the constant term from the second, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}\\) and \\(b^k\\). So, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Okay, so that takes care of the first part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will just be coefficients themselves, but they don't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just get multiplied by constants from the second expansion, but it won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in that expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), all those scalings just add up. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts, I get a product where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by terms in the second part, it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if there is one. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (if any) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which was 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, is that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or are there other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the second expansion? Let me think: If I have a term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first part and a term \\(c^m\\) from the second part, then the product would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\). The only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(m = 0\\), because if \\(m\\) is non-zero, then you'd have \\(c^m\\) attached, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), which is not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider the coefficients from the second part as well?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which only involves \\(c\\), the terms from the second expansion won't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would include many terms, each of which would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), since \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me verify that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent for \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term where \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so yes, that's 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, when expanded, what's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But no, actually, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but that would actually be an infinite number of terms if the second expansion had an infinite number of terms, but in reality, the second expansion only has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not quite right because the second expansion isn't just a sum of coefficients; each term has a specific power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But actually, no, that's not the case. Each term in the product is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because when I thought about it earlier, I considered only the constant term. So, I'm confused now. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But when I initially thought, I considered only the constant term, which gave me 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. But let's expand it: \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a/c\\)), so total coefficient is 2. Similarly for \\(b\\). So, that seems to check out.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier approach where I considered only the constant term, giving 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. But wait, let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut in my earlier approach, I considered only the constant term in the second expansion, which gave me 120. But according to the smaller example, that approach would be incorrect because the coefficient of \\(a\\) in that example is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients but also with powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Because if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. Since the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), perhaps it's intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\"

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient is 20. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we just multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when k=2 in the binomial expansion, so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): we need the term where the exponent is 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives m=3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. \n\nTherefore, when you multiply the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20 = 120. \n\nI think that's right. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, right? So, in the expansion, when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\).

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. Does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling each term by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but no, that can't be right because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number, but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient in the entire product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But that seems complicated because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but since the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just a constant term. That might make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, let me try that approach. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me first expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are separate variables, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).

Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), say \\(c^k\\), then the result would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them together, you get terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, and the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be when the exponents cancel out. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is it correct to multiply the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Maybe it's considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nLet me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in one part don't affect the coefficients in the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since we're multiplying by another expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other terms in the second expression would just contribute as a multiplier to the coefficient. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, if I expand the entire product, what's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the other terms might involve \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply 6 by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by that constant, resulting in a term that's just a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when we multiply by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) comes from the expansion where \\(k = 2\\), giving the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is \\(6a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But in this case, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that part is zero. Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would give \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient from the second part is 1 for the constant term, but that's not quite accurate because it's not a variable term. Wait, no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, that's why the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I haven't missed anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first is multiplied by the constant term from the second, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6.

But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have another part multiplied by this. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and I multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those products will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), that would give you \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part doesn't change the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just check again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), but the second part is multiplied by it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, but the second expansion might contribute other terms.

So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I got it right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " So, I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this expression, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just get multiplied by constants (the coefficients from the second part's expansion). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6 in the first part, when I multiply by the second part, it's going to be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part. Because the constant term is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, right? Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to zero. Let me find that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the other parts? Hmm, actually, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term is affected by the other part. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but actually, no. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then I multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will have their own coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I'm supposed to sum over all possible coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the powers of \\(c\\) must be zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would include \\(c\\) to some power, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be the case. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expression, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a coefficient but an expression. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense. So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That sounds right. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The original problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical values, not expressions. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, I think my earlier reasoning is correct, and the answer is 120. But just to double-check, let me consider another approach. Suppose I treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, that can't be right. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. So, that would indeed be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).
