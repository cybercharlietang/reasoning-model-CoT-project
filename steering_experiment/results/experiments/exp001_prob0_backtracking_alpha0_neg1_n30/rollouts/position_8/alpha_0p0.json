    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they might just be referring to the part from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but that seems unlikely because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but considering all terms, including those from the other part. But that seems confusing because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, because that part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is being expanded, and we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients wouldn't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, as we found earlier, and the rest of the expression doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expansion, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that when you multiply out the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would still be 6. But wait, let me check that. Let me write out the expansion more carefully. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire product is a sum of terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would become \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the way the terms combine. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, as that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just 6. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the multiplication works. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would still be 6, because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me try to clarify. Suppose we have two separate expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as in the first expression, because each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expression. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems different from my initial thought. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, without considering the other part. But the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", so it's possible that it's considering the entire expression. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6. But I'm confused because the problem includes both expressions multiplied together. Let me try to clarify. When you have a product of two expressions, each term in the product is a product of terms from each expression. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would accumulate all those products. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, that makes sense because each term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Suppose we have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient in P(a, b) because Q(c) doesn't involve a or b. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. If I have P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6, then the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). When you multiply these, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of Q(c). The sum of the coefficients of Q(c) is found by setting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of Q(c), which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in P(a, b), but now I see that it's actually 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). Let me think of a simpler example to verify. Suppose P(a, b) = (a + b)^1 = a + b, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's c + 1/c. But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of c, then it's the sum of the coefficients of Q(c), which is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is 1 (from P) times 2 (sum of coefficients in Q). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. So, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, after this detailed thought process, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to multiply this by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this coefficient. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their coefficients would multiply with the coefficients from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, so when you expand it, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, the second part, involving \\(c\\), will contribute a coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part would just be 1? Or maybe not. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, actually, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give me the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with the corresponding coefficient. So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But we are only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which we found has a coefficient of 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, it's just 6 * 20. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) would give \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would give \\(b^2 c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire product is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)) = 2. But wait, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient in the first part (1) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part (1 + 1 = 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the terms from the second expansion won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), their coefficient is 6, as I found earlier, and the second part doesn't affect that because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - j}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j} \\). So, when I multiply these two, each term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j} \\). So, the entire expression is a sum over all \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) of \\( \\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j} \\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(i = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, since the second part is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\) where \\(k = 6 - 2j\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we just consider the coefficient as 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate? Or do we need to sum over all possible \\(j\\)?\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2j}\\) with coefficient \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). Wait, that can't be right because that would be 6 times the sum of all binomial coefficients for the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and all the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of all terms in the second expansion). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The expression is a product of two separate expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's break it down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is zero. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - j}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which implies \\(j = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6\u00d76} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \u00d7 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) is also to the zero power) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + d)^3\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and it would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + d)^3\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^1d^2\\), then it's 1 \u00d7 \\(\\dbinom{3}{2} = 3\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6. But that seems inconsistent because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, making the coefficient a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not sure because the presence of \\(c\\) terms complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I think the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will be 6 \u00d7 coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's not a single number, it's a polynomial. But since the problem asks for a coefficient, it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), in which case it's 6, but that seems unlikely because the presence of \\(c\\) would affect the coefficient in the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply, the terms are combined. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \u00d7 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 384. Alternatively, if I set \\(c\\) to another value, I'd get a different coefficient. But I don't think that's the right approach because the problem isn't specifying any particular value for \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c"

    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That implies that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how that term is affected by the multiplication. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Hmm, wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when multiplied by the second factor, which involves \\(c\\), it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), the only way to have a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute 6!/(3!3!) correctly. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the product of the coefficients from both expansions, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me try again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient is just a scalar. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and considering the \\(c\\) terms, I might be interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero, so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that seems right. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so their product is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the entire expression, which would involve the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the answer should be 120. \n\nLet me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any terms involving \\(c\\). That means I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a separate expansion, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means any terms that don't involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to those exponents won't affect the coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a factor of 1 when considering the coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the second expansion is multiplied by the first, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the term in the first expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, perhaps I need to consider that the second expansion can have any power of \\(c\\), but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, the second expansion can be considered as a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are separate terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the part that comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is when \\(k = 0\\), but wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you get terms like \\(20a^2b^2c\\) or \\(20a^2b^2/c\\), but those aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), so the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I was confused earlier because I was considering the entire expansion, but actually, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Maybe I need to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it's not a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but we don't care about their exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

But that still doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because they are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're supposed to have a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but only regarding the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts. So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\).

But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so we can treat the entire second expansion as a single term. Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient, so maybe we can leave it like that. But I'm not sure if that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but only regarding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that interpretation. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, and we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems like a reasonable interpretation. Let me proceed with that. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but earlier I thought the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean it's multiplied by the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but only the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense, and the answer would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

Or maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? Wait, the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that seems odd. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a term with some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would make \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times\\) (coefficient in second expansion) times \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each coefficient, but each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number, but a sum of terms each with a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's a single number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a constant term. Wait, no, the second part is not a constant. Let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I had before. So, when \\(m = 0\\), it's \\(c^6\\), \\(m = 1\\), it's \\(6c^4\\), \\(m = 2\\), it's \\(15c^2\\), \\(m = 3\\), it's \\(20c^0 = 20\\), \\(m = 4\\), it's \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(m = 5\\), it's \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(m = 6\\), it's \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the second part has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). Now, when you multiply the first part, which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, each multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all these 6 times coefficients. But that's not quite right because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the answer is 120, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem expects a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the second expansion again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it differently. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a polynomial in four variables: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, each of which is of the form \\(k c^n\\) where \\(k\\) is a coefficient and \\(n\\) is an integer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each coefficient \\(k\\) in the second expansion would be multiplied by 6 and attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct approach is to consider the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'm not sure. However, considering that the problem is from a math competition or something similar, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a"

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, when I multiply out the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can consider that term separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for a specific term, say \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then that term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^k\\) from the second part. But in this problem, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. That means that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, which would include various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the entire expression is a product. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient would accumulate all the possible coefficients from the second part. So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you would take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, to find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify this approach because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe the correct approach is to realize that when you expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) vary. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times 64, so 384. Let me check this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then multiply the terms. So, let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term from the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by every term in the second part. So, each of those terms will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all possible coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer. But that's not a standard way to interpret coefficients. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering a monomial with specific exponents for all variables. So, in this case, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), then you would compute \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = 4\\), so \\(m = 1\\), giving \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that suggests that we're supposed to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and consider the coefficient regardless of its power. However, that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But assuming the problem is as written, I think the intended answer is 384, which is 6 times 64, the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Therefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In other words, when you expand the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that feels a bit off because I think the problem might be expecting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering the \\(c\\) terms. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which effectively adds up all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplies by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be (1 choose 1) times (1 choose 0) = 1 * 1 = 1, but in the product, the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, \\(a/c\\) is 1, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try another method. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that is multiplied by 6, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in all those products. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that is multiplied by 6 and attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so that suggests my logic is flawed. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. In the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion, but in my smaller example, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when it exists, which is in the first expansion, and then multiplied by the entire second expansion. But in the smaller example, since \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present, the coefficient is zero, which contradicts my earlier logic. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me clarify: in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), which would result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms. So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in my smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present, so the coefficient is zero, which aligns with the fact that the first expansion doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the original problem, since the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because every term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, I'll have to consider how the terms from each expansion combine. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean I need to consider all terms where the product of the terms from both expansions gives \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is \\(a^2b^2\\) only in the first part and unaffected by the second part? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me clarify: The expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants with respect to all variables. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the part that involves \\(a^2b^2\\), and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would just be 6, as we found earlier, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo and meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. So, let's proceed under that assumption because otherwise, the problem seems a bit ambiguous.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the answer is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but I don't think that's the case. Maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But that seems odd because \\(c\\) is another variable. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has various terms, each with coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate all the coefficients from the second polynomial. So, if the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\) or something, then we would need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's simply the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't seem right because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\).

That seems to make sense.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute the second part's sum of coefficients again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is what's being asked. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when expanded, which occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the expansion, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm wrong in assuming it's \\(c^0\\). It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's considering all terms regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm now confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 120 or 384.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of it as a product of two polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each coefficient in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a symmetric polynomial because the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are symmetric. The coefficients are the same when read from the start or the end. So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the entire expression, this coefficient is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). Let me set up the equations: \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider something else? Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term. So, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, they might be treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and they just want the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of the entire expression, treating all variables together. Hmm, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That seems odd. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the sense of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unclear. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables together, but since \\(c\\) is involved, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of the first part, and the second part is separate. So, the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the expansion. But the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so it's the product of the two expansions. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating all variables together, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is the product of both expressions. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   The original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we only care about the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where m ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}\\), etc., each multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply by the first part, which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1} + \\dbinom{6}{2} + \\dots + \\dbinom{6}{6}\\). The sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\), so here it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. If the problem had been to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives terms involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion manually. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that checks out. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from more than one term in the first expansion? No, because in the first expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so only one term will have \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is uniquely 6. Then, when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which has a sum of coefficients 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but I think this makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " That would correspond to the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, right? So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is just a constant multiplier when considering only \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the value of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider all terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see how they interact with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would just be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term in the first expansion, when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would create multiple terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because if there's any \\(c\\) term, then it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that would give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that logic again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient there is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, it gives the coefficient 120. If there were any \\(c\\) terms involved, they would change the exponent of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\) at all, we just need to multiply the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I need to consider both parts. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. So, does that mean that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. When we multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, but the variables also multiply. So, if I'm only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but since I'm only looking for the term without \\(c\\), which is when \\(k = 0\\), perhaps? Wait, no, because in the second part, each term is a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be when the second part is 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the second part only contributes the constant term. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it? Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because they are separate variables. So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those will be a separate term in the final product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, as I thought earlier, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think my initial conclusion was correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That checks out. So, yes, the constant term is 20. So, multiplying that by 6 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. If I were to multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only be when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. The second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part and \\(c\\) in another, the terms in the product will have all possible combinations. But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the expansion, and the other part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured such that we're supposed to treat the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might be it. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, since each term in the second part contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just being multiplied by each of those.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do we find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, is the answer 384?\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are separate. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, as we found by setting \\(c = 1\\), then yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The first part, \\((a + b)^2\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient as \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The second part, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check by expanding the entire product: \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\). Expanding, we get \\(a^2c + a^2*(1/c) + 2ab c + 2ab*(1/c) + b^2c + b^2*(1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present here because the second polynomial only has degree 1 in \\(c\\). Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the second polynomial. Wait, but in our initial approach, we thought it would be 2, which is incorrect. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my previous method, I would have said 1 * 2 = 2, which is wrong. So, my initial approach is flawed. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the original problem, the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all present, and when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the product will have powers of \\(a, b, c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, and sum their coefficients, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but in the simpler case I tried earlier, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, why is that?\n\nWait, in the simpler case, \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second polynomial doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term. But in the original problem, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is just multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which only affects the power of \\(c\\). So, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it just adds different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient remains 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but in the simpler case, the second polynomial had \\(c + 1/c\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get terms with \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because there's no term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. But according to my initial approach, I would have thought it's 2, which is wrong. So, that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, but rather, 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, in the original problem, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. So, that would give us the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me test this approach with the simpler case. In the simpler case, \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is zero because the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 (from the first polynomial) times 0, which is 0, which is correct. So, that seems to work.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is needed. Let me compute that. To find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first polynomial) times 20 (from the second polynomial), which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. Let me check this approach again with the simpler case. If I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is zero, as we saw earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct. Another test case: suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero because it's only to the first power. Wait, no, actually, in \\((a + b)^1\\), the coefficients are 1 for \\(a\\) and 1 for \\(b\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero, which is correct because the product would have terms like \\(a c^2\\), \\(a * 1/c^2\\), \\(b c^2\\), \\(b * 1/c^2\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that works.\n\nAnother test case: \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). We found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me see if that makes sense. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\), including a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. All other terms in the product would have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by all coefficients, which was incorrect. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try expanding both polynomials and see if the coefficient comes out to 120.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think means the coefficient in the entire product. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the other variables. But that might not make sense because the other part involves \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. So, when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't give a numerical coefficient. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, \\dots, c^{-6}\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that. So, if I have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero for the constant term. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and we're multiplying by the constant term 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's a bit ambiguous. But in the context, since the expression involves both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), it's likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if they want the entire coefficient, which includes all powers of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a number. But since the problem asks for a coefficient, which is usually a number, I think the intended answer is 120. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, in the binomial expansion, the exponent of a is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of b is k. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging k = 2 into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means when I multiply out the entire expression, the coefficients for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you expand the entire expression, you have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various terms from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's simply the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\), and the coefficient would be the \"something with c\" part. But if that's the case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a constant, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just a constant coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, assuming that the only term contributing is the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. Let me verify that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me check if that makes sense. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20.

In that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient.

So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify, so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the product of the coefficients, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term that includes \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again: the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, you're effectively taking each term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product unless it's multiplied by a term that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Because otherwise, you have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times the coefficient from the first part, which was 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify that again. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), it would have been different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, leaving a constant term. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. \n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in other words, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term (if any) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check that. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be constant, the exponent must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The original expression is the product of two expansions, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply terms, the exponents add. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) has no \\(c\\) term, the \\(c\\) exponents must cancel out, which happens only in the constant term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because they multiply in the overall expression.\n4. The result is 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem on \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply only if the variables are the same. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients in the product will be the product of their respective coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, why \\(c^0\\)?

So, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about how to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is indeed when \\(m = 3\\), which gives a coefficient of 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients multiply independently. Also, correctly identifying the term in the second binomial expansion that gives \\(c^0\\) was important. I think that's all there is to it.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other part, it's just scaling the entire expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, first, let me confirm the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part. That seems correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients. But let me check if that's the case. Let me consider a simpler case: suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times (sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 2), so 2. But if I expand the entire expression, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is \\(a^1b^0\\)) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. Wait, but in the original problem, the variables are separate, so perhaps the coefficient is considered in terms of all possible terms, but I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the expanded expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the expansion, considering all variables, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these terms is then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, as found earlier, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, so maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would multiply each term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, as the other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term where \\(k = 2\\) (to get \\(a^2b^2\\)), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but only when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense.

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when finding the overall coefficient. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part of the product, right? Because the second part is in terms of c and 1/c, which don't involve a or b. So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve a or b? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of c and 1/c, which are separate variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Oh, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the product of two expressions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering c. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the terms involving c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. But that might not be correct either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as another variable. But since c is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, which isn't typical. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where c is raised to the 0 power, meaning it's just 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms combine, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of c is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).\n   - The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are multiplied by the \\((a + b)^4\\) term, when we expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), which are not pure \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about how to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720/36 = 20. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36 which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, going back, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), we have the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, including \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) is \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or could there be other terms in the expansion that, when multiplied together, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. For example, could there be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^k\\), but then somehow the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) change? No, because when you multiply two terms, the exponents add. But in this case, we're only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not with \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to have a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But wait, no, because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), that term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are not pure \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and see if there's another way to approach it. But I think the method I used is correct. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. Let me check that. \n\nWait, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms, maybe the problem is actually considering the product and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. That way, the coefficient would just be a number. Let me try that approach. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. That would make sense, and the answer would be 120. \n\nLet me double-check this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the answer would involve \\(k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is to consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, I think 120 is the right answer. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed. Then, for each \\(m\\), the term would be multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're looking for the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, that's why we took \\(m = 3\\) to get the constant term, and then multiplied by 6, giving 120. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I should think about this more carefully. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if any terms in the second expansion will affect this coefficient. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the original problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) dependence. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, but that seems not right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term's coefficient would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply that by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the corresponding coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial; it has to be a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But the problem as stated just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the corresponding coefficient in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 from the first part. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving a and b are separate from the terms involving c and 1/c. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. Wait, but let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by terms involving c, the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. So, unless we're looking for a specific term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some c terms, but the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 1 (if there's a constant term in the second expansion), but wait, let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is present only once in the first expansion, with coefficient 6. When we multiply by the second expansion, which is a sum of terms involving c, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're only interested in the term where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponents of c. But in the product, each term will have both a and b exponents and c exponents. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of c is 0) in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with c^k, you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From the expansion I did earlier, the constant term occurs when the exponent of c is 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term when m=3 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20 gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, but let me confirm this. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the terms multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.
