    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see if the other part contributes anything. But wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, you have to consider all possible terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\). Let me think about that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) which has a coefficient of 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will expand into terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in front of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term with \\(c\\) would make the exponent of \\(c\\) non-zero, and since the problem doesn't mention \\(c\\), I think we can assume that only the constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient in the product would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial's terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term of the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the term would be \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0\\), which is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but another thought: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, so if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term \\(20\\) from the second part, then the product term is \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2\\), which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms (involving \\(c\\)) won't affect it. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that can't be right because each term in the product would be the product of a term from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the same as evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. Let me check that. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as the product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't correct because the coefficient is a single number. I must be misunderstanding something. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\) because of the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, that is, \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, for each such term, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^{m - n}\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we need to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-n}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product only if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), that is, a constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. So, that makes more sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by the entire expansion, which I now realize was incorrect. So, the correct approach is to realize that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the entire expansion, but now I see that only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but that might not be necessary. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as I found earlier, which is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\).

But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, meaning that the coefficient would be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, as I found earlier.

Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are numbers, not expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to \\(c^0\\). That is, the constant term in \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, let me try that approach. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, to find this, I need to consider both expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From the first expansion, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, I get 6 times that constant term as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually numerical.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then ignoring the other part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part in the expression. So, to sum up, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering the constant term in \\(c\\), making the coefficient 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Hmm, actually, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some terms involving \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of the two expansions. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor, but multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's the term from the first expansion. But then, this term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part's terms involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that seems off because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion's terms are being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Next, we need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, let's set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and those coefficients will be added together to form the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the second part is multiplied as a whole, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because when you expand the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the expansion of the second part is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all m from 0 to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, I think the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the product of the expansions, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, their coefficients don't interfere. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient is just 6, and the other terms would involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is even. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when multiplied, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6, but I think the more likely interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would be part of a larger expression involving \\(c\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second.

Hmm, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me try a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term is scaled by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose instead of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), let's take \\((a + b)^1\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it's 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(1/c\\) is 1. So, the total coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sum. So, that seems to work. So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then considering the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**  \n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:  \n   \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Or do I? Hmm, maybe I need to consider how these two parts interact. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the expansion is for the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expression. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product, each term will be of the form (coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) * (coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the expression, and we're to find the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and not involving \\(c\\) at all, but that doesn't make sense because the expression includes \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already found to be 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be different. Because then I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me think. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2m = 0 => m = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered in the entire expression, so perhaps it's 384. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product for all values of \\(m\\), each multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. Let me confirm this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 2. Alternatively, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) would be 1 * 1 = 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expression), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term. Then, as I calculated earlier, that would be 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all m of (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part). But the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum over all coefficients from the second part is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.

Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that when you expand the entire expression, what is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, so that the coefficient is a sum over all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the other expansion. So, let me proceed with that assumption. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem was considering all the coefficients, but now I'm thinking that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), so perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire product is considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify, so maybe I should assume that it's asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not consider the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part at all, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both factors. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving us 20. Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then involve terms with \\(c\\), which we're not interested in. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\) would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of a specific term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are numbers, not expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression as a single polynomial and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Let me check that reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about it as a product of two independent polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, meaning that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Usually, coefficients are for specific terms. So, maybe the problem is only interested in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems reasonable. Let me try to verify this with a smaller exponent to see if my reasoning holds. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) for \\(a^0b^2\\). Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and \\(a^0b^2\\) is also 1. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) would also be \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Let me check that with a smaller example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1 = c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Multiplying them: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. But if we set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient becomes 2, which matches the earlier calculation. So, in the original problem, if we set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying this by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), we get \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different values of \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that would only happen if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, so when you multiply them, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term involving \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.

But that seems too simplistic. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms would just be part of the overall expression. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by the entire expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expression. But that can't be because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems off because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the answer is 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Let me consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and has a coefficient of 6. When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6 because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, using the binomial theorem. Since the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, they do not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

But wait, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not, because the second part is multiplied by the first part. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, but that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the second part is a separate variable, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but since the second part is a sum, it's more complicated. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not exactly right because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those products will have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the entire product includes terms with \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part? Or is it more nuanced? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms, each of which is a multiple of \\(c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). When you multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're introducing factors of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself remains as 6 times the entire second part. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since the product includes \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that seems off because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that exists in the product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and then multiplied by each term in the second part, which has \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient in the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the second part is a separate variable, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But how do I find the sum of coefficients in the second part? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that can't be because the second part is part of the product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the second part is multiplied by the first, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expression, which is not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is a separate term, so when you multiply, the coefficient is just 6 times the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that's not the case because the second part is a variable expression. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6 times the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these coefficients becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6? Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. As established, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I need to consider whether the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, the first expression only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which doesn't affect the term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I think it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(C \\times a^{2}b^{2} \\times c^{k}\\), where \\(C\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(k\\) is the exponent from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients \\(C\\) times the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), we need to take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by 6, you would be considering all the terms, but actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the terms involving \\(c\\) would create terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because other terms in the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) in it, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\).

Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.

So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expression. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying that, the \\(c\\) terms become \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which happens when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, each term is multiplied by this 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when we multiply by the first part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first part, the coefficient in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term's coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's find that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would imply that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^3b \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), and so on, but also terms where \\(c\\) is in the denominator, like \\(a^4 \\times c^{-6}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, because setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but it doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. Let me check that. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 0. Let's apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I should consider that the problem is only concerned with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, regardless of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's part of the product. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, especially since the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's all, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, in that case, the coefficient is just 6. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more likely because it's a common type of problem where you have to consider multiple variables. So, perhaps the answer is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion, meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\) without mentioning \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be the case. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we take the coefficient 20 and multiply it by 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6, but given the structure of the expression, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product, including the \\(c\\) terms, and specifically when \\(c\\) is zero, which would require the term with \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption: that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is the problem actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? If so, then perhaps the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, it's an expression. So, the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, which includes both \\(a, b, c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, I think my earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 120 is correct. Let me recap: In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. Then, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a function of \\(c\\), not a number. But the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, so that suggests that perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that would be 6, which seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are supposed to be constants. So, the only way this makes sense is if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. So, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, my final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients together:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, the second part is multiplied by the first part, so if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the corresponding term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term.

But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{2}b^{2}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Because the sum of binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems high, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a total of \\(2^6 = 64\\) terms, each multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Because in reality, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in the first expansion, its coefficient is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which has a total coefficient sum of 64, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, but \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from the first part, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, let me find that coefficient. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well.

But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would give me the overall coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. That seems correct. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the steps.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't actually need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I might have misunderstood. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. No, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only term in the product that will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, it will have some power of \\(c\\), so the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would mean that in the expanded form, all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, it will have a \\(c\\) term, so the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial.

Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, first, let me find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Is there a possibility that other terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, no, because any term that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would mean that when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, only the constant term in the second expression would affect that. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through each step again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, I think that's correct.

So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I calculated before, is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe another way to think about it is that since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), which we don't care about, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polynomial's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, so each term in the first polynomial's \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that would make sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so it's probably expecting the coefficient considering the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), maybe it's just considering the coefficient as a number, combining all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, it's probably just the coefficient as a numerical factor, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then summed together. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can factor out the 6 and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me first expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms will be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), we have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the sum \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as each binomial coefficient summed over \\(m\\) gives the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor of \\(2^6 = 64\\) when considering the sum of all its coefficients, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
