    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should break this down into two parts because it's a product of two binomial expressions. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the terms involve different variables, \\(a, b, c\\), I guess the coefficients from each part can be multiplied together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, does that mean I only need to consider the first part for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I should just focus on the first binomial expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part at all since the term we're interested in doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that way, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the variables.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I considered everything correctly. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes only from the second part. So when we multiply them, the variables \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what we're looking for. There are no other terms in the second expansion that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because all other terms involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would change the variables. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other part of the product only contributes a scalar coefficient (20) when considering the \\(c^0\\) term, the overall coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **First Part: \\((a + b)^4\\)**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).\n   - We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\).\n   - This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Second Part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**\n   - We need the term that contributes to \\(c^0\\) because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n   - Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), gives \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining Both Parts**\n   - The total coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). That means I need to find the coefficient when \\(k = 2\\) because \\(b^k\\) would be \\(b^2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the other part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's separate from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which means I need to consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. That is, the terms in the second expression that are constants (since they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by their coefficients.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the constant terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how the terms interact.\n\nActually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). \n\nWait, but actually, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes many terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) in them? Or are we supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? \n\nI think it's the latter. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term from the other expansion)}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the other expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense because the second part is being multiplied entirely, so each term in the second part contributes to scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the question is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes to scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to various terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 15a^2b^2c^2 + 20a^2b^2 + 15a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), which are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding those up: 1+6=7, 7+15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, the coefficient is 64. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, no, because in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 64, not 6*64. \n\nWait, that can't be right because in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384. But in the example I just did, when I multiplied each term, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) etc., are 1,6,15,20,15,6,1, which sum to 64. But that's because in the second expansion, each term is multiplied by the entire first expansion. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients become the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just 6, but 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term with its own power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm considering all possible terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, in the example I did earlier, when I multiplied out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) was 6*1=6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) was 6*6=36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) was 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2\\) was 6*20=120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) was 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) was 6*6=36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) was 6*1=6. Adding all these up: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. \n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) is 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But in my earlier example, when I multiplied it out, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all powers of \\(c\\), is 384. \n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which would be 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify, so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion with coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, to calculate that, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, our \\(n\\) is 4 for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), I get the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't sound right because the entire expansion would contribute a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nOh, I see! The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, collect all the terms, and look for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), what is the coefficient of that term, and it can have any power of \\(c\\) attached to it. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, and summing their coefficients. \n\nBut actually, no, that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of expressions, you're supposed to find the coefficient of that term, considering all the other variables as well. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not an expression. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. \n\nWait, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. \n\nThat makes more sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the coefficients from both expansions where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) add up appropriately. \n\nSo, breaking it down: \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, because the exponents of \\(c\\) will range from 6 down to -6 in steps of -2, I think. Wait, no, actually, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, so 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. Since these are multiplied together in the product, their coefficients multiply as well, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by calculating the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplying them together. \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to expand the entire expression, just the part where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the entire expression, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other factors.\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when we multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a factor that is the sum of all its terms, but since we're looking for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, actually, I was wrong before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression isn't just 6, because when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you take the product of the specific terms. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't just 6, because the entire expression includes another expansion, and we have to consider the constant term from that part to find the overall coefficient. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We are looking for the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you expand expressions like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). \n\nSo, specifically, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check that: \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nIn other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's as if we're treating the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single coefficient. But that might not be the case because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, but in the product, each term would be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. So if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\text{something} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{something else} \\), then each term in the product is a term from the first multiplied by a term from the second. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be zero because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical.\n\nSo if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So let's approach it that way.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as calculated before.\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for all possible \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So it's possible that the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But since it's not specified, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely expecting the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, making the coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let's think about the product: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of these terms, meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\): 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\), which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, which would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), making the coefficient 6*20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's 6*20 = 120, considering the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That seems more plausible.\n\nWait, to confirm, let's think about the expansion: each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient where \\(c\\) is zero, which is 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check with an example. Let's take a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1*(1) = 1, but if I consider the entire expansion, it's 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed step by step without overcomplicating. Let me try to calculate it as if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nSince the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended answer is 120,"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me figure out which term that is. Since the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 4, and I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I don't need to worry about the coefficients here because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I think that part just contributes a constant factor when multiplied by the first part.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the combined coefficient is 6 * 20, which is 120. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression.\n\nLet me break down the problem into two parts: first, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), and second, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I'll multiply the two expansions together and look for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the variables in each part are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a coefficient that I need to multiply by. \n\nSo, perhaps I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two terms together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), I need to make sure that the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., it doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) in it. That way, when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the variables, and I'll just get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of the overall product.\n\nSo, let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(b^2\\). Since the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2m \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients I found from each part. That is, 6 multiplied by 20.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is 6, that's correct. Then, for the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately and then combine them. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, so maybe I can expand each part and then multiply them together, looking for the specific term.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\).\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I'll use the binomial theorem here. Each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so I'm a bit confused here because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does this mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of the second part, each term from the second part will be multiplied by 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to take 6 and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, and then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s power, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part). But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, then the total coefficient would be 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts and see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k=2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the product is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(6a^2b^2\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times \\left( \\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} \\right)\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through, we get:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{0}a^2b^2c^6 + 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{1}a^2b^2c^4 + 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{2}a^2b^2c^2 + 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}a^2b^2c^0 + \\text{other terms}\n\\]\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in each case is 6 times the respective binomial coefficient. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is the sum of all these 6 times binomial coefficients.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all binomial coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the binomial coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), since when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s power. So, in that case, it would be 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's considering the entire product, so it's the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and that coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific terms. For example, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have coefficient 6 * 1 = 6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have coefficient 6 * 6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) would be 6 * 20 = 120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nAdding all these up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's compute:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that adds up to 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me verify the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), so the sum of those coefficients is 64, as calculated earlier. Therefore, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n  "

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes solely from the first part \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient should be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part involves \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the rest would involve \\(c\\) terms, which we don't care about.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part doesn't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient should just be 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, but since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together, but that would be impossible because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables. So, the only way the problem makes sense is if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just multiplied as a scalar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that we're supposed to consider the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually numerical. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, meaning the constant term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me check. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, but that term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but that would require combining terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, the first part will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by coefficients. The second part will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times 1/c = c^4\\), \\(c^4 \\times 1/c^2 = c^2\\), etc. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, if I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. When I multiply these together, I get 120. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the constant term in \\(c\\) is 20, then yes, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), maybe it's considering the entire coefficient, which is 120 times \\(c^0\\), so 120 is the coefficient. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the coefficients appropriately.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means I should find the coefficient when \\(k = 2\\).\n\nCalculating that, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Got that part.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I'll use the binomial theorem here. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Hmm, I need to figure out what the coefficient is for each term, but wait, how does this relate to the original problem?\n\nWait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by 1 (from the \\(c\\) terms), it just adds up all the coefficients.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be \\(6\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they just add up.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64\\). Let me compute that: 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, it's only multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\), it would still have \\(c\\) in it, so the only term that would result in a term without \\(c\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, maybe I was wrong earlier. Instead of multiplying by the sum of all coefficients, I should only multiply by the coefficient of the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think again.\n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720 divided by 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. The original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it will be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I should consider all the terms in the second part, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) will be the sum of all those contributions.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion, but the entire expression includes terms with \\(c\\) as well. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, that would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if I plug \\(c = 1\\) into the second part, I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, and then 6 times 64 is 384. But that would be the case if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expression. But in reality, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in P(a, b), it will be multiplied by each term in Q(c), so the coefficient in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the product of the two.\n\nWait, but in this case, Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each coefficient in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120. So, which is it?\n\nLet me take a step back. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) times (term from second expansion). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), or just the term where \\(c^k\\) is zero?\n\nI think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier. But let me verify this by considering a simpler example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1.\n\nNow, \\((c + 1)^1 = c + 1\\). The sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's check by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1) = a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\).\n\nLooking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), which is the term \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2\\). So, the coefficients are 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) and 1 (from \\(a^2\\)), so total coefficient is 2, which matches \\(1 \\times 2\\).\n\nTherefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the sum of coefficients from the second part (which is 64), giving 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was only considering the constant term in the second part. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. However, the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which means summing over all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any \\(m\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that only the constant term contributes, but that's only if we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum of all contributions from the second part.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} +"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can apply the binomial theorem here. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nI notice that the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so how does this affect the overall expression?\n\nWait, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I'm looking for terms where the product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the power of \\(c\\) can be anything, as long as the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But wait, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from first part) \\times (coefficient from second part) times \\(a^{something} b^{something} c^{something}\\).\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum will be multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the product will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the terms where \\(a^{4 - k} b^k\\) is equal to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as calculated before.\n\nBut now, the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), is multiplied by this 6. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all m from 0 to 6, because each term in the second sum is multiplied by the 6 from the first part.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the second sum isn't a single term but a sum over m. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. But wait, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, because in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in any expansion is found by setting c = 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of c is zero. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it would be 384, but that might not make sense because the problem might be expecting a specific term where c is raised to a certain power.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about c, so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. But that would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in c. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all c terms, which might not be intended.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nHmm, it just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it might mean that regardless of the power of c, we're just looking for how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if it's looking for the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in a, b, and c. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{2}b^{2}c^{k}\\), where k can be any integer. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all c terms, which might not be intended.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of c to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 6*20=120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I should clarify. If the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nHmm, it doesn't specify anything about c, so perhaps it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're considering the term in the entire product, which would involve specific exponents for all variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible powers of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me try to see if I can find a way where the answer is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Because if you consider the entire product, each term is \\(a^k b^{4 -k} c^{m}\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any restriction on c, that would mean all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of c, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, giving 384.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each polynomial where the exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in c, and the first is in a and b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every possible term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain because I'm not sure if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or just \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see if I can find a source or example that clarifies this.\n\nWait, in general, when you have a product of polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each polynomial where the exponents match. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where k is a specific integer, then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my reasoning again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the problem is in three variables, but perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1)^1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in (a + b)^2, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in (c + 1), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be "

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I think I can expand this to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that out. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider the entire product? But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the c terms because they don't affect the a and b coefficients? Let me think about that.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be anything because it doesn't involve a or b. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing because the second expansion has many terms, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve c, which are separate variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, but the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. That is, when you multiply everything out, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and each time, it's multiplied by some combination of c terms, but since we're only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, maybe we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that might not be correct either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you might get terms with different powers of c, and we might be looking for the term where the power of c is zero, so that we have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about c, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it again.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, that would mean that when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various terms involving c, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression, because each term in the second expression would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and the second part can be any term, so each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the coefficient of each term in the second part. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, if the second part had variables, but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then we would have to compute the product of the coefficients from both parts, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\), where k ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), I think.\n\nWait, actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where m ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponents of c will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so the coefficient for each of those terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 times the binomial coefficient.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of c, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of c is zero, which would be the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense too, because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum involving different powers of c, which isn't a single number.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about c, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that we can treat the second factor as a constant with respect to a and b, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but assuming it's not, I think the correct approach is to recognize that when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients.\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a^1b^0\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, adding up to 2. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. Expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying, the terms with \\(a^2\\) would be \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\), so the coefficients are 1, 2, and 1, adding up to 4. That works too.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but perhaps only the constant term in c. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when m = 3, because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when m = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. It could be either 384 or 120, depending on whether we're considering all coefficients from the second part or just the constant term.\n\nWait, let's check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about c, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut in the example I did earlier, when I considered \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) was 2, which included both \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\). So, in that case, the problem would have been phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a\\)\", not \"the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\)\" or something like that. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to treat the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, c, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible c terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and confirm the sum of coefficients. As I did before, setting c = 1, we get (1 + 1)^6 = 64"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the coefficients, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nI think the key here is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the multiplication by the second part will just scale the coefficient.\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when I multiply it by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms are multiplied together. But in this case, the first part has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), all the terms are in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, I'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself unless the second part has a constant term.\n\nWait a minute, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut that can't be right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second part, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second part. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that's the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. If we have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), that's a different term and doesn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because only the constant term in the second part will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part.\n\nSo, let me correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Let's compute that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem and is 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can use that here for both parts of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only concerned with the terms in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) because the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together?\n\nLet me break it down. First, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. \n\nI need the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient we're looking for? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single coefficient, and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nBut actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. However, since the problem is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) just get multiplied by 1, or perhaps they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so that would involve all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), but I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that might be the case, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, then I can consider that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all its coefficients because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I might be missing something because the problem is presented as if it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire product's expansion will have terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider if the terms can combine in a way that affects the coefficient. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficients from each part, but that's not quite right because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient might involve more steps, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Then, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a scalar (6) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by the entire second expansion, you get 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either because the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the problem might be considering only the constant term or something else. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that each term becomes its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial, not a scalar. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Since each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). And since the sum of coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is 2^6=64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all specified. But the problem as stated is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the coefficient, and since the second expansion can have any power of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second expansion is multiplied by that, the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a separate term.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so we can treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But since we're not concerned with \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered, and the second part can be anything, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's think about it differently. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), and \\(c^0\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each contributing 1 to the coefficient. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2.\n\nWait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (coefficient from first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients from second part). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*2=4, and so on.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from second part) = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? In that case, we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nThe constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) = 120.\n\nBut the problem as stated is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, it's ambiguous whether it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically for \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6*20=120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nIt just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, we get:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in this part. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms in the second expansion? Hmm, let me think. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms in the second expansion will be multiplied by 1 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without c or 1/c). Wait, no, actually, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean I need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the c terms? But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the a and b variables. The c terms are separate variables, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the c terms? Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in a and b, and another in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, any term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c or 1/c. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second expansion has terms with c and 1/c, which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in c.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, they want the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that might not be the right approach. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without c, that would mean that we're looking for the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's work on that. How do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when k = 3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But the only term that will result in a term without c is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to think about this? Suppose I consider the entire expansion, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that sum is when c = 1, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that's different from 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, that approach is wrong because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, but that would imply that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms, which isn't the case. Actually, each term in the product would have different powers of a, b, c, and 1/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only include the terms where the exponents of c and 1/c cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, to clarify, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no c terms, we need to find all combinations where the exponents of c in the second polynomial sum to zero. That is, only the constant term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then we would have to consider the term from the second polynomial with exponent k. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the term where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, perhaps the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term?

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you have to consider all the terms in the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar (without any \\(c\\) terms), the coefficient would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. But actually, that's not how it works. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, that's why it's the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, I think my initial reasoning was correct. The coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients together, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me write that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the term for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in that part.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) just needs to contribute a constant term when multiplied. Hmm, that might be the case.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\), as they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense.

Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part.

Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, so when you multiply them out, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider only the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the rest can be any term from the second expansion.

However, the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we just need the coefficient from the second expansion when it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the product will have terms where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part's expansion is separate.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of each term. But in this case, we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't just a number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let's consider a simpler case: suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. If I expand it, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2 (from \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2\\)), which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (from \\((c + 1)\\)).

Then, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

But actually, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term from the second part can be any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the product (involving \\(c\\)) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut actually, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any term from it multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just add a factor involving \\(c\\) to it. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), do we need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion? Or is there a specific term we need to pick?\n\nWait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut actually, that might not make sense because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, we need to find the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's sufficient to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Or is there a specific term in the second part that we need to multiply by?\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). As I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nEach term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let's calculate that.\n\nThe sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\): \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to multiply 6 by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, which means summing up all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. Sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem, this would expand to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms in this expansion would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the other parts of the expression. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might only need to consider the part of the second expression that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, perhaps the rest of the terms in the second expression can be considered as a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it's separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be 6 times whatever the entire second expression is. But wait, that's not right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's possible that the second expression might have terms that could affect the coefficient if there were more variables, but in this case, since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient that is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which usually is a number. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I think the problem expects a numerical coefficient. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, in that case, I can approach it as follows: The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as the product of two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's write it out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it as the product of the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, and the coefficients multiply as well. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product and see if there's another way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be thought of as a product of two independent expansions. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should write out the entire product and see. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the problem is asking for the entire coefficient, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem asks for the coefficient, implying a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more involved, and the problem might just expect the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to clarify, let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's this entire expression. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, I specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Let me think about how that term would look. If \\(a\\) is raised to the 2nd power, then \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

Hmm, so does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, I think it might not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a factor of 1, right?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is raised to the 6th power, maybe I need to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion?\n\nWait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would give me the sum of coefficients as \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But then, if I multiply 6 (from the first part) by 64, I get 384. But that seems high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in any expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that accurate? Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me see if that makes sense. Let me take a simpler example to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is (1 + 1) = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. That seems correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficients get scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the cross terms would just contribute different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems too small. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated before, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Let me compute the entire product.\n\nFirst, compute \\((a + b)^4\\). As we saw, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6a^2b^2) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Since the second expansion has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in each case will just be 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms of (6 * coefficient of that term in the second expansion), which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6, and the rest of the terms with \\(c\\) would just be multiplied along, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would still be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have each term from the first expansion multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me check that.\n\nIf I think of the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. Because any other term from the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), and thus the product would have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nFrom earlier, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from the 384 I got earlier. So, which is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, only when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(k = 0\\)) in the second expansion do you get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which approach is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term.\n\nIn this case, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply a term from the first polynomial that has \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, only the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant term will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as calculated before.\n\nIn the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus just on that term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me compute that coefficient. Using the binomial coefficient formula, which is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\), where \\(n\\) is the exponent and \\(k\\) is the term number. Here, \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2 because \\(a\\) is raised to the 2nd power and \\(b\\) is also raised to the 2nd power. \n\nSo, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient we just found. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I notice that this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms in the second part won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. \n\nSo, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part needs to be multiplied by the term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms multiply. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's coefficient for the constant term is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only combine with the constant term from the second part (the term with \\(c^0\\)) to give a term that is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, giving 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We are looking for the term that is independent of \\(c\\), which corresponds to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSetting the exponent equal to 0, we solve for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of the term \\(c^0\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but in the product, it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). So, does the problem mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\)? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would vary depending on \\(k\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), but that would still involve multiple coefficients for different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in multiple coefficients for different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check this again. \n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with various powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all these coefficients. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\) respectively. \n\nSo, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each of these terms from the second part, resulting in coefficients 6*1, 6*6, 6*15, 6*20, 6*15, 6*6, 6*1 for the respective powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's just 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6*20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and considering that the product is in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems more accurate because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nLet me confirm this approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if we include the \\(c\\) terms, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would depend on \\(k\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's the third term in the expansion. Let me calculate the coefficient for that term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. That means I need to consider how the terms from each expansion interact when multiplied together.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part.\n\nBut wait, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Let me think about that. \n\nWhen I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = A \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B \\), then the product is \\( A \\times B \\). So, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is a scalar (6) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by terms in \\(B\\), which involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result will be terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part introduces factors of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(B\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come if there's a term in \\(B\\) that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, you can't get rid of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\).\n\nThe coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is just 20) from the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me think. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first part and \\(c^m c^{-n}\\) from the second part, but the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is when \\(m = n\\), which in the second part is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Since these are independent variables, their coefficients multiply when you take the product of the two expansions.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. I used the binomial theorem correctly for both parts, found the coefficients for the required terms, and then multiplied them together because they are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That would mean \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will still result in a term containing \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, unless the second part contributes something that affects \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which it doesn't, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering the coefficient in the entire product, but only for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part? Or are we supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something specific in \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that's present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're considering the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, or maybe it's just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, because the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will just add another factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms from the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to consider that the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains the same as in the first part. \n\nWait, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut let me think again. Let's denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term in \\(Q(c)\\), it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no, because in the product, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut is that correct? Let me think about it. If \\(P(a, b)\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., then the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times S\\), where \\(S\\) is the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me test it with a smaller example. Suppose \\(P(a, b) = a + b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 1/c\\). Then, the product is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not straightforward. \n\nWait, but in the problem, we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nIf I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, each of these terms is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term where \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\) in the second expansion, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me verify that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent is zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought about whether the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that was a mistake. The correct approach is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied only by the constant term in the second part to result in a term that has just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product comes from the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. \n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. \n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me figure out which term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) corresponds to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this term interacts with the other part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait a second, I realize that the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. \n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nOh, I see now. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient attached to it, considering all possible terms from the second binomial.\n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second binomial expansion, each term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (something with \\(c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a separate variable, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem as stated is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to 0. \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. \n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nHmm, it's ambiguous. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the question expects a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense, as it would result in a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). \n\nWait, let me think. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit off because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: It's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term with \\(c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nLet me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and multiply them together.\n\nSo, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem expects a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): that's 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), but without specifying \\(c\\), perhaps it's intended to consider the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leading to the coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem expects a numerical answer, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately and then multiply them together. So, maybe I should expand both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) individually and see what the coefficients are for the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I remember that the binomial theorem can be used here. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). \n\nI need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, where \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). \n\nThe expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut wait, the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, we'll be looking for the product of the coefficients where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by any term from the second part. \n\nHowever, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that right? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think again. When we multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplying by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nBut that seems off because the second expression has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, because only then would the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expression that is \\(c^0\\), which is just 1, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, let me check that. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me calculate it correctly. \n\n6! is 720, 3! is 6, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to find the corresponding coefficients, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to consider the entire expression as a single polynomial, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, so maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would give a term \\(6a^2b^2 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a single coefficient but a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the entire expression. That would make more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we found earlier to be 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I think that's not what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's referring to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\) in the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying terms from the two polynomials. But since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). If I multiply them, I get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 2. But in reality, the terms are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is actually 1 times each term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nWhen we multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is the sum of all the coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking because it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomial multiplication, the coefficient of a term is the coefficient when considering all variables. So, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) that multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and it's multiplied by"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be the term where \\(k = 2\\), right? Because in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), so if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I need to consider the coefficients from both parts?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would give a sum, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a sum of terms each with some power of \\(c\\), but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that seems too big. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), you multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire product as a single expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, because the other part is multiplied by any term in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively multiplying each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6.\n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)).\n\nBut the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
