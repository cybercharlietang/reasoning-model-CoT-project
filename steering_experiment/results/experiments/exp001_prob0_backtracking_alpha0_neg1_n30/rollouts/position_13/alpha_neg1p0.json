    "text": " \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then the entire expression is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be, because in the product, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c^k\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire expression, the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the rest of the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is an expression in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) term, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are not just a single number; each term has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, if I think of the entire expression as a product, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to find the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. For example, maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see if there's another term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which gives 6. And in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that contributes to the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a different power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^2\\), then I would have to calculate the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\). But since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents in the product will be additive from each part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients would combine, but since the variables are different, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would actually mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because the variables are separate. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the coefficient of every term in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the product. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is simply 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because the variables are independent. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would include all the coefficients. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the \\(c\\) part as a separate factor. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest is multiplied by that, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo confirm, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means that in the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of that \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by different variables. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which is just \\(a^2\\), then in the product, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1*2=2, which matches the product \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient 2. So, that seems to check out. \n\nSimilarly, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product, it's 2ab times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, which matches the terms 2abc and 2ab/c, each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient 4. \n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient in the product would be 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in effect, it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's equivalent to evaluating the product at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Wait, but that might not be the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can separate the variables. Since \\(a, b, c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches. So, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms from the second expansion. But actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems to be the case. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\), the multiplication would indeed result in each term from the first being multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Let me compute the entire expansion step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which confirms that the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem perhaps asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero? Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, people might be interested in the constant term with respect to another variable. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer would be 384.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be a different problem, but the problem doesn't specify that. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the entire product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2(1/c^2) + 36a^2b^2(1/c^4) + 6a^2b^2(1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term as it is, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would change the variables. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find the term in the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term with only \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20 * 6 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I might need to consider how the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) interacts with \\((a + b)^4\\).

But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables, so when you multiply them, the terms don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you have two separate variables, the coefficients don't just multiply the entire sum. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.

But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product, each term would be of the form (coefficient from \\(a + b\\)) times (coefficient from \\(c + 1/c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would be different because then I would have to find the term where in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the constant term. Let me check that approach.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial where each term is multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it from another angle. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables, so the terms don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the product step by step. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check this again. When you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, multiplying that by 6 gives 384. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the other terms are in different variables, so they don't affect the coefficient. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have coefficients scaled by the other expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the number of terms, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), and then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not present in the second part of the expression, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple for each term in the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but each term has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that approach is wrong because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is present only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there's no overlap in variables. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds another factor of that coefficient. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that with an example. Let me take a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is 1. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). But let's expand it: \\(a \\times c + a \\times (1/c) + b \\times c + b \\times (1/c)\\). The term \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient is indeed 2, which matches \\(1 \\times 2\\). So, that seems correct. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient would be 4, which is correct because the expansion would have \\(a^2c^2 + a^2 \\times 2 + a^2 \\times (1/c^2)\\), so the coefficient is indeed 4. So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part just scales it by its entire expansion. So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the entire expansion is, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a coefficient times another expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger expression where \\(c\\) terms are also involved. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which gives terms involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these two terms together, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Since the variables are independent, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible.\n\nBut let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, the coefficient gets multiplied by each term's coefficient, and since the second part's terms are in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1*2=2. So, in that case, it works. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the entire expansion and see. Let's try that. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when asking for a coefficient, you specify the exponents of all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense, and the coefficient would be 6*20=120.\n\nWait, that's a different answer. So, perhaps I need to clarify: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem as stated is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*64=384. But in the expansion, as I showed earlier, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6*20=120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then in the product, that term comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) (from the first part) by the constant term in the second expansion. The constant term in the second expansion is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, so the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But that's not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6*64=384, but that's only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6*64=384. But that's when \\(c=1\\), which isn't the same as the original problem. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, I must conclude that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times the second polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient. Therefore, the only way for the coefficient to be a single number is if we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we just need the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then perhaps that's all? Wait, no, that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients combine. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first product, and it's multiplied by every term in the second product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too easy, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expansion, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I think that's not the case. \n\nWait, let me try to approach this differently. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how the terms multiply. So, first, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these will be a term in the product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term in the product has different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(c^0\\). Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to find the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a function of \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, as I calculated before, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I expand the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term has a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient of a term in a product is usually a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms in the first polynomial are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in the second polynomial are in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. But that seems too simplistic, and the problem probably expects a more involved answer. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated earlier. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems plausible. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire product would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that's when \\(c = 1\\), which isn't necessarily the case. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, but that's not the same as the coefficient in the general case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too easy, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) term, so it's probably expecting me to consider that as well. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial doesn't interact with the \\(c\\) terms in the second polynomial because they're in different variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of both parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but only for the same powers of the variables. However, in this case, the variables in the first part are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second part, they're \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents in each part don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are different, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term from the second expansion)}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the entire product, we're looking for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from those terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make much sense because the second part has variables. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be different. Let me see. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But let me double-check that logic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That is, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me see. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Now, I'm confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be 384 or 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all terms in the other part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just a single number; it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). If I expand this, I get \\(a^2c + a^2 + ab c + ab + b^2c + b^2 + ...\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1\\), because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, if I were to write the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the polynomial obtained by multiplying 6 by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Wait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another way. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by substituting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But to be thorough, let me verify. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem does not specify any condition on \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Okay, so that's the coefficient from the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are combined with the \\(c\\) terms. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by each term in the first part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving \\(c\\) will just be coefficients multiplied by that term, but they won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is being multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's like treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes the expansion from the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, but that seems too simple. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the coefficient is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by the other terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, the problem specifically says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient multiplied by all the other terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is being multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not what the problem says. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the expression, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the other terms. Hmm, I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the other terms involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the answer is 6. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's only when \\(c = 1\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression, not when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps that approach isn't correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to multiply the coefficients, but since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient is just 6. I think I'm going to go with that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. So, the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, I think the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. Since the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{6}."

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is multiplied, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all those terms, but the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that's not standard. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering \\(c\\). So, that is, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't change that. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not sure because I feel like I might be missing something. Let me try to think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is carried through to the product, multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, does that make sense? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms would have a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term would be 6 times each of those coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're considering all possible terms in the expansion, and we want the coefficient for any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it has. But that's not standard because coefficients are specific to the entire monomial. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just there to multiply the entire expression, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^3\\). What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 (since \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\)). Then, when multiplied by \\((c + 1)^3\\), each term in \\((a + b)^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1)^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1)^3\\), which is \\(2^3 = 8\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 8. So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, let me double-check that. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in this part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by whatever the constant term is in the second part. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, and that's the one we need to multiply by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion that isn't \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense.

Wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe that part doesn't directly affect it. Or does it? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient from the second expansion must be such that when multiplied by the first part, it doesn't change the variables. Wait, but actually, the second part is being multiplied by the first, so any term in the second expansion that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would be multiplied by a term from the first expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that way, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion will contribute a factor that is the sum of all its terms, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through it again. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I'm looking for the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't see any mistakes here. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so the sum is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have an infinite number of coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constants. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way.\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the terms from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which will have multiple terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would give a different term in the product. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to a different term in the final product, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). When we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of these terms. So, in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these coefficients, each time with a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with the same \\(a^2b^2\\) but different \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 384. But let me check that. Let me expand both parts separately. First, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The sum of the coefficients here is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, does the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part affect this? Hmm, I think so. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any terms from the second part, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think that means we're treating \\(c\\) and its reciprocal as separate variables, but when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too large. Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're to treat it as a term without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. \n\nOkay, so let's tackle that. The expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the product of the two coefficients. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. Since in \\((a + b)^4\\) the coefficient is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, then the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only multiplied by the constant term (in \\(c\\)) from the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or something else. Hmm, I think the approach is correct. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the constant term is. Using the binomial expansion, as I did before, the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of each term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these, you get 6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider the general case. If I have two polynomials P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by a specific term in Q(c) would be the product of their coefficients. So, in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c) is 20, so when you multiply P and Q, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), we would have to consider the product of the coefficients from each part, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we're only concerned with the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, the variables are independent. That is, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by 1 (since any term without \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) would just contribute 1 when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)), but actually, no, wait, that's not quite right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake there. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\), the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the part involving \\(c\\) would just contribute a factor of 1 when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two parts are multiplied together, and the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the part involving \\(c\\) will just be the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q(c)\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let's calculate that. \n\nFirst, let's compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64. \n\nEarlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 times 64 would be 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Let me go through it again. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSince in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), where \\(k\\) varies. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when we collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient that is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the result is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 2. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)\\) is \\(2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 times 2, which is 4. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiply by \\((c + 1)\\): \\(a^2(c + 1) + 2ab(c + 1) + b^2(c + 1)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times (c + 1), which would be 2c + 2. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is indeed 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)\\), which is 2 times 2 = 4. So, that seems to check out. \n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the coefficient directly. Let me try that. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed. The part involving \\(c\\) would be any term, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is exactly what we had before. So, that confirms that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't realize that, I might have thought to separate the variables, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients would multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate factor, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling that coefficient by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the coefficient I found, 6, is just from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. But the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. So, does that mean the coefficient in the entire expression is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the multiplication by the second expression doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, when we're talking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expression. Wait, no. That doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is being multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with a coefficient that is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P and Q. P = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + ... and Q = q_0 + q_1y + q_2y^2 + ... Then, P*Q = p_0q_0 + p_0q_1y + p_0q_2y^2 + ... + p_1x q_0 + p_1x q_1y + ... So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of x^2y^3, it's p_2 * q_3. But in this case, the variables are separate: the first polynomial is in a and b, the second is in c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, which are in c. So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no. That's not quite right. Because the second expression is in terms of c, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expression. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in c. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, how many terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\), and what is their combined coefficient? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some k, but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expression. Because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, we need to sum all those coefficients. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Alternatively, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting c = 1. So, let's compute the second expression at c = 1: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when c = 1, which is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think differently. If I have two expressions, P(a, b) and Q(c), then P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial in c. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to c. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a numerical answer. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of c cancel out. That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because \\(c^0\\) is the constant term in the second expression. So, let me check that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under a different interpretation. Now, this makes more sense because it's a specific term where the exponents of c cancel out. So, I think this is the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to consider how the two expansions interact. Since the expression is a product of two binomial expansions, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the variables are different (the first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)), the variables don't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is multiplied by the first, so actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire sum of the second expansion. But that can't be right because the question is asking for a specific term. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) and so on. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the same expression. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, maybe the coefficient will be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's considering the coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would require summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would again give a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I should interpret the problem as: in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in standard terminology would mean the coefficient regardless of other variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is involved, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a function of \\(c\\). But the problem is presented as a single answer, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret the problem. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that in the entire expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Since the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", which is typically a number, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, making the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1. So, 120 is the answer.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), i.e., \\(m = 3\\).

So, when I multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part can be anything, but when multiplied, it will affect the overall term. Wait, but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when multiplied, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the expansion, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps I need to clarify: Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, the problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they might be referring to the coefficient in front of that term, considering all variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient would include the terms from the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion multiplied by the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it would contribute 6 times each coefficient. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) part is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the rest is handled by the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unclear. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm. Maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Then, when I multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number, so that can't be the case. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the coefficient without the \\(c\\) terms. That is, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), so that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that each term becomes just the coefficient. So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by the entire second expression, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both expressions multiplied together. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by that term, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second polynomial would be multiplied by 6 when considering the product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. Let me assume that. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in this case, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was not asking for \\(c^0\\) but just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it just contributes a scalar multiple when multiplied by the first part. Let me check that. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is a power of \\(c\\). But since the original problem is about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and their coefficient, maybe the \\(c\\) terms just multiply through as a constant. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that particular coefficient. Let me think. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each of those terms would be something like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\) into the expression, which would give \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\) when \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. So, when \\(m = 3\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0 = 1\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 6 times 64, which is 384, but that was when I considered all coefficients, which isn't correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients times the respective power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, earlier I thought that the constant term was 20, so maybe I'm confused. Let me clarify: When you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in the second expansion)}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes to a different term in the product. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might be making a mistake. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not polynomials. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But the problem statement isn't specific about the power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's considering all possible \\(k\\), which would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting answers here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by all the terms in the other expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then that would make sense. So, the answer would be 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients"

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so its coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense if we're just looking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe that's the case. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, maybe that's the approach.\n\nLet me confirm that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which doesn't make much sense unless we're looking for the constant term in the second part. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. So, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, if we consider the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar. Therefore, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the expression is a product of two parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part, but that seems odd because the entire expression is a product. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just the scalar coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a certain power, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make the coefficient a scalar, 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a scalar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might not be expecting that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a red herring. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), and we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of \\(c^m\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all such terms, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part is separate, so the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check this by considering specific values. Let me assign specific values to \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and see what the coefficient would be.\n\nSuppose \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^4 = (1 + 1)^4 = 16\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product is 16 * 64 = 1024.\n\nNow, if I look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), when \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\), it's just 1. So, the coefficient would be the number of times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, multiplied by the corresponding terms from the second part. But in this case, since \\(c = 1\\), the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, because the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the second part is 64. But wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the second factor. But that seems off because the second factor is an expression, not a number.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the original problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\".\n\nSince the expression is a product of two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part, which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical answer in a box, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term from the second part.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated to be 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient of 120.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient when multiplied together. Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. That is, I just need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because multiplying by a constant won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, if there are terms with \\(c\\) raised to some power, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any powers of \\(c\\), perhaps we're just looking for the constant term. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when multiplied together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I think I need to consider the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and the second part would contribute a scalar multiple. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion of the second part has multiple terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would be the case if we were considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the first part, regardless of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because the second part is just a scalar multiple. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, because for each \\(m\\), we get a term with \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each \\(m\\) contributes a term to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, we would need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm confused because the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and 1, giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of a specific term in the first part is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Therefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, each coefficient in the first part is multiplied by 64, because the second part evaluates to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be different. For example, if it asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). But since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check again with another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which matches the idea that each coefficient in the first part is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, yes, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the specific term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would involve finding the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), as I did earlier, resulting in 120. But since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire expression would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, effectively, it's summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I've convinced myself that the correct answer is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficients in the second part don't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, I need to consider how it interacts with the second part. \n\nWait a second, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if I'm considering the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is just a single term with coefficient 6. When I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms each with different powers of \\(c\\), the result would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in this expansion would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But the original question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, meaning 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and then multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that would require the second part to contribute a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nThe constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second part, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients for each power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. \n\nWait, the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting only the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought maybe it's only the constant term, but the problem didn't specify. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is the product of both parts, so the coefficient would be affected by the second part. \n\nWait, but let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, if I consider the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps I should treat the two parts as separate and just multiply the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me try to see what the standard approach would be. When asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, without specifying other variables, it's usually considering the term in the combined expression, which includes all variables. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each power of \\(c\\), there's a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all coefficients of these terms. But that would be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I actually expand it, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, because it's \\(ac + a/c\\), which can be written as \\(a(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, in this case, the approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 4, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2 + 2 = 4,"

Hmm, so perhaps I need to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I can treat the two parts separately because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, if I denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient just gets multiplied by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in \\(Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). Therefore, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), depending on the expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, that would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, with some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions. So, yes, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me double-check by expanding both parts a bit more. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). The coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum of these coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, but only if we're considering the same term in each. But in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which gives us the total coefficient. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that seems odd because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that might not make sense because when you multiply, each term is combined with all the terms from the other polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, simplifying, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, the term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a specific number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the earlier analysis, each term from the second part has \\(c^{2m - 6}\\), so setting \\(2m - 6 = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in the second expansion where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm correct. Let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a constant. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\) in the term we're looking for, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, maybe the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring the \\(c\\) part. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, so it must be a specific number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by actually expanding the expressions. Let's consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 20a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 1a^2b^2c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only in the term \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression is 120, as that's the only term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's not a single number but a polynomial, which contradicts the nature of the problem. Hence, the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well, but wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or maybe I do because when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms might affect the overall coefficient. Hmm, let me think. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the combined expression. But actually, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384, but that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because the coefficients in the second part are not just numbers; they have variables attached. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you're just scaling each term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that's the case. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first polynomial, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the resulting terms in the product will be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that we're considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it's just scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a single number. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing coefficients and terms. Let me clarify: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me think of the entire product as two separate polynomials multiplied together. The first is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving different variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a separate entity. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Let me confirm by calculating the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which equals 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."
