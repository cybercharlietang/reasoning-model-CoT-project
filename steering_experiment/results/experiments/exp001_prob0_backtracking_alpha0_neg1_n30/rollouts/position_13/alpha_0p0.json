    "text": " \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't actually need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those are separate variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the entire expression is the product of two binomials, each expanded. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that means we only need the constant term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't want any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, so let me confirm that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{(constant term in the second expansion)}\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

    "text": " Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well or if it's just a multiplier. Wait, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect that specific term. Let me think. The expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if you multiply by the term that's \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the constant term the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply by that term, it's the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Alternatively, could there be other terms that somehow combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Hmm, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way to get it is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, I think my reasoning is correct. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, let me check if I did everything correctly. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20\\). So, yes, 20 is correct. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying the terms, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is straightforward and correct.

Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the terms from the first part without affecting the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be because the answer should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, that can't be right because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives me \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Is that correct? Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right.

That means, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, that's not correct because the variables are different.

But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an expression, not a number. Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent is zero. That is, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then perhaps we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the idea is that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the other expansion), giving 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we'd have to consider a specific \\(k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're assuming \\(c^0\\), the constant term.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the second expression is multiplied by each term in the first, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficients for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, any term involving \\(c\\) will be multiplied by the corresponding \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient gets multiplied by the corresponding coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the product as \\((\\text{something with }a \\text{ and } b) \\times (\\text{something with }c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be accurate because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, that would make the total coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me double-check by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 2. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)^1\\) is 2 (since it's \\(c + 1\\), coefficients are 1 and 1, sum to 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). Multiplying them: \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The term \\(2ab\\) is present, and its coefficient is 2. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, it should be 2 * 2 = 4. But in reality, it's 2. Hmm, so that suggests that my earlier approach is incorrect. Wait, so in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2, not 4. So, my initial approach was wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this. So, where did I go wrong? Let me analyze. In the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is indeed 2, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\), because when you multiply by \\((c + 1)\\), you're adding a term with \\(c\\) and a term without \\(c\\). So, the term \\(ab\\) comes from \\(2ab \\times c\\) and \\(2ab \\times 1\\), but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)\\) by \\((c + 1)\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and by \\(1\\), so the resulting terms are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 (from \\(2ab \\times 1\\)), and the coefficient of \\(abc\\) is 2 (from \\(2ab \\times c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2, which is the same as in \\((a + b)^2\\), because when you multiply by \\((c + 1)\\), you're effectively scaling each term by 1 and adding another term with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) remains 2, but now there's also a term with \\(abc\\) which has coefficient 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is the same as in the original \\((a + b)^2\\), because the other term in the second polynomial is 1. But in our original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but in the simpler example, that approach didn't hold because when I multiplied by \\((c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) was still 2, not 2*2=4. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect, and I need to think differently. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) must cancel out to get a term without \\(c\\), so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can exist on its own without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But in the simpler example, that approach didn't hold. Wait, in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2, which is the same as in \\((a + b)^2\\), because when you multiply by \\((c + 1)\\), you're effectively scaling each term by 1 and adding a term with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) remains 2, but there's also a term with \\(abc\\) which has coefficient 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is not scaled by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, but rather remains the same. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other polynomial doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents of \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient accumulates as the sum of these products. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but earlier, in the simpler example, this approach didn't hold. So, why is that? Let me check. In the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2, but according to this approach, it should be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} \\times (1 + 1) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\), which contradicts the actual expansion where the coefficient is 2. So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning. Let me analyze again. In the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). When multiplied by \\((c + 1)\\), each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and by 1. So, the term \\(2ab\\) becomes \\(2abc + 2ab\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 (from \\(2ab \\times 1\\)), and the coefficient of \\(abc\\) is 2 (from \\(2ab \\times c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is not scaled by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, but rather remains 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial has a term with coefficient 1. Wait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients that sum to 64. So, why in the simpler example, the coefficient wasn't scaled by the sum, but in the original problem, it is? Hmm, perhaps because in the simpler example, the second polynomial has a term with coefficient 1, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) isn't scaled, but in the original problem, the second polynomial's entire expansion is multiplied, so the coefficient accumulates across all terms. Wait, no, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think differently. In the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 in \\((a + b)^2\\), and when multiplied by \\((c + 1)\\), it becomes 2ab + 2abc. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(abc\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is the same as in the original polynomial, because the second polynomial contributes a 1 and a \\(c\\). So, the 1 doesn't change the coefficient, but the \\(c\\) adds another term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) isn't scaled by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, but rather remains the same. Therefore, in the original problem, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second polynomial is being multiplied as a whole, but that doesn't seem right because in the original problem, the second polynomial has multiple terms, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler example, this approach didn't hold because the second polynomial had a term with coefficient 1, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) remained the same. Wait, but in the simpler example, the second polynomial was \\((c + 1)\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 2, so according to the approach, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) should be 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, it's 2. So, that suggests that the approach is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is wrong, and I need to think differently. Let me try another way. Let me consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\("

So, does that mean the \\(c\\) terms will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the two parts separately. Let me think again. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

In the other expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reread the problem to make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's consider the entire expansion. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that can't be right because that would imply that every term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, which isn't the case. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, and that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the entire product is considered, and they are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large and probably not the intended answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if there's a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, each term would have either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a problem. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. Hmm, that suggests that in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero unless we're considering specific exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2\\). So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean it's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just speculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they're referring to a specific monomial term, including all variables. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that's not standard. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me think of the product as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the entire expansion of the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of a specific term, such as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate both possibilities and see which makes more sense. If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the second part suggests that \\(c\\) is involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, I think that's the most reasonable interpretation.\n\nTherefore, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, is that right? Let me think. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, because the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would have multiple terms. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the entire second expression is a scalar multiplier for the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, which is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will not interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but considering that \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second factor, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But when you're looking for a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in the entire product, you can think of it as 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by 6, each term would contribute 6 times that coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each of those would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might mean the coefficient in the entire expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a combined expression, and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check this. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term where \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), and that term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part.

So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when we multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might mean that the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because typically, when you have multiple variables, you specify all the exponents. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't standard. So, let me try that approach.

Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but wait, no, that's not right because the second part has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that's why we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not standard. Usually, you specify all variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. So, that would make sense, and as calculated, it's 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems unlikely because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?

But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would result in a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all the terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and we're summing their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (sum of coefficients). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion would have multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nTo do this, I can expand both parts separately and then find the appropriate term. So, first, as I did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply these two coefficients together. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0, which is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial where each term is 6 * (some coefficient) times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. Correct.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 * 20 = 120. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the expansion is a product of a term from each polynomial. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term in the product have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we only consider the cases where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. Alternatively, if I think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then any term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are interested in terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's fixed, and we're looking for terms where \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(c^0\\), which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recompute the binomial coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): 4 choose 2 is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): 6 choose 3 is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be because each term in the product will be \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(c^m\\) times \\(1/c^n\\) or something like that. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\) times \\(c^{m}\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), so that's 6, and then multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.

Let me check again: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term regardless of the \\(c\\) part, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but that might not be the case because the second expansion could have multiple terms, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute to different terms in the final product. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, and the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the answer is 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would still just be 6, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, the first part gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and when multiplied by the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), etc. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. Wait, but that's not the case here because in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms will have a coefficient of 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all possible terms. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that might be it. Because when you expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check this again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer should be 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can treat the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would just be 6, as calculated from the first part. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the terms are combined by adding exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not just 6, because 6 is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. That is, 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler case: suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). When I multiply them, I get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, in this product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. Therefore, in this case, the coefficient is zero. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning because the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 2 times the coefficient from the first part would be 2 times 1 (for \\(a^2\\)) plus 2 times 2 (for \\(ab\\)) plus 2 times 1 (for \\(b^2\\)), but that's not how it works. Hmm, maybe my approach was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. But the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms specified. So, perhaps the answer is 6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, which is 384. But in the simpler example I did earlier, that approach didn't hold because the coefficient was zero. Wait, but in that example, the first part was \\((a + b)^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which makes sense. So, in the original problem, since the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me try to confirm. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:**\n   Since each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Is the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion?

Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficient would be 6 times each of those coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but in reality, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are separate from the \\(c\\) parts. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from the first part, and the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part evaluated at the specific \\(c\\) term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expression, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me think again: when you have two separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the \\(c\\) part is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense because when you have a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other in \\(c\\), the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it before. Let me think again: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion, but when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. When you have two independent variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients multiply independently. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just a constant (with respect to \\(c\\)) and doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any terms involving \\(c\\) would be separate. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest involving \\(c\\) are separate terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second part, the coefficients would carry over. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded as some terms involving \\(c\\), when you multiply them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, in the overall product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. The rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when multiplied by 6, would give a term 6 times each term in its expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but perhaps that's not the case. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me confirm this by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can combine differently, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients should multiply directly. So, yes, I think 384 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients we found in each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the terms that result in the same variables. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. That makes sense because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient by that amount.

But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both expressions, so it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which would be 64. But now, by looking for the constant term, I get 20, and multiplying by 6 gives 120. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But if we're considering the product as a whole, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expression, each of which is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20, so 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is ambiguous. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If we're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, if we're considering the entire expansion and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think the intended interpretation is the latter: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's think about it: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20, so 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. But that's only if we're considering the sum of all coefficients, i.e., setting \\(c = 1\\). But if we're specifically looking for the constant term, then it's 20, giving 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120 is the answer. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression, which isn't a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider both interpretations.\n\nInterpretation 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression, which isn't a number, so this interpretation might not make sense.\n\nInterpretation 2: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20, so 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nBut let me verify by expanding both expressions.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nThe constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 384, but that was under a different interpretation. I think the correct interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, I need to consider how the terms combine. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't 1, it's \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, if you have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms} \\), then when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\) (the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all those products. So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, I think the correct approach is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check this again because I might be confusing the concepts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because the problem is likely asking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. So, let's recast the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me confirm this. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need to find the term in the second part where \\(c\\) cancels out, which is when the exponent is 0, as I did earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

That makes sense because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in the second expression is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is independent, so when I take the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion is just the product of the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is being multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so each of those contributes to the overall coefficient. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). When I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum over all m of 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6. But the sum of the binomial coefficients from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so again, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms in the second part won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider the entire expression. But wait, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the \\(c\\) terms separately because they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be multiplied by a sum, not a single term. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is an expansion, so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only contribution comes from the term in the first part that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large because the sum would include all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is a lot. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all the variables together, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient is just 6, as in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems too simple, so maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we also need to consider the \\(c\\) terms such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might be it. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems correct. Let me double-check. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number, so maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve summing over all possible coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which we already found to be 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\).

But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. Wait, that might be it. Let me think: If we have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial would give the total coefficient for that term when considering all possible combinations. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make sense because then we're looking for the specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as before. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under a different interpretation. Let me check which interpretation is correct. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\), the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.

That might make sense. So, let me check that. If I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's try that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps they are considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would still require more context. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would still involve \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems reasonable. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This constant term is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gives the coefficient as 20. Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
