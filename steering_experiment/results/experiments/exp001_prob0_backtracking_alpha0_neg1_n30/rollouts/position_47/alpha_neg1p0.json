Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).

    "text": " So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, their coefficients multiply, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. That seems correct.

I think that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me confirm the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion includes terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply the 20 from the second, giving 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).

Is there a possibility that when expanding both expressions, other terms could combine in a way that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but still give \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c\\) from the second part, but then multiply by another term that has \\(1/c\\), would that somehow result in a term without \\(c\\)? Hmm, but in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.
