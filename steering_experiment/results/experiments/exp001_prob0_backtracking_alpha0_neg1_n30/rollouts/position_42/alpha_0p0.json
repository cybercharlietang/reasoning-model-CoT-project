So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. Sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere with each other. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part.

But in this case, since the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Hmm, but since the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power, and we're looking for a specific term, the approach I took seems appropriate. I don't think I need to use multinomial coefficients here because each part is independent of the other variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part, as I did before. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, let me also check the calculation of the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that again: 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems solid.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me consider the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two sums, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that gives us the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply this by the sum of all terms from the second polynomial that have \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but another thought: what if I considered the entire expansion and looked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients I found. So, yes, 120.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the calculations check out. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that's only possible when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).
