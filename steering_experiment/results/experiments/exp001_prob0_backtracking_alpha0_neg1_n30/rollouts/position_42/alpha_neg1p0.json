Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That seems consistent.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem specifically asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, we're looking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because any other exponent of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. So, yes, that approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the same as 120. But since it just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), that's the same thing because the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these, you're effectively taking each term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the product would include terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, including \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 120 because that's the only term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, that's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, but only the constant term affects that coefficient. So, yes, 120 should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when m=3, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). So, yes, multiplying those gives 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial, as any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which we don't want. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense.
