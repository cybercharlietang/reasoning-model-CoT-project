Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which we don't want because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yes, it makes sense that we only multiply the coefficients from each respective term. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
