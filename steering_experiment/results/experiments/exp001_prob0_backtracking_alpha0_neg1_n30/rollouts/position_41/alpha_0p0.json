Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, and each term in the product would be of the form (coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\)) * (coefficient from \\(c^k\\)) * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the term without any \\(c\\), that is \\(k = 0\\), so only the constant term contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I expand both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), with coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it would create terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(24a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the only term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) is when we multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, that gives \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2\\), which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Yeah, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
