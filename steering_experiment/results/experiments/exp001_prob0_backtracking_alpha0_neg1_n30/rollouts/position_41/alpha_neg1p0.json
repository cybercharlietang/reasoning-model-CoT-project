Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by expanding both parts and looking at the coefficients. But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, could I have made a mistake in assuming that only the constant term from the second polynomial affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Let me check: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the second term is \\(c^0\\). Because if the second term has \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the product would have a \\(c^k\\) term, which we don't want. So, yes, only the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, my initial approach was correct.\n\nAnother check: maybe I can consider specific values. Let me assign specific values to \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and compute both the original expression and the coefficient to see if they match. For simplicity, let me set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Then, the original expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^4 \\times 2^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, as I found earlier. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(1^2 \\times 1^2 = 1\\), and when multiplied by 120, gives 120. But the total expression evaluates to 1024. Wait, that doesn't seem to match. Hmm, that might be a problem. Let me think. Oh, wait, no, because when I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes a number, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one part of it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, but the total expression is much larger. So, maybe that approach isn't the best way to check. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, so when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes 120 to the total expression. Let me compute the total expression with \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\): as before, it's 1024. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, and its coefficient is 120, so when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), it contributes 120. But the total expression is 1024, which is much larger, so that doesn't help much. Maybe I should try a different approach to verify. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of the two expansions and see if the coefficient is indeed 120. Let me try that. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore all terms in the second polynomial except the constant term, which is 20. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. That confirms my earlier calculation. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is multiplied by all terms in the second, but only the constant term in the second contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Since we're looking for the term that's \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other polynomial is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe expanding both parts fully and then looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems more complicated because expanding both binomial expressions would take a lot of time, and I don't think it's necessary since the reasoning above seems solid. Alternatively, I could consider the multinomial theorem, but in this case, since each part is a binomial, the binomial theorem suffices.\n\nWait, another thought: is the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all terms from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, so that's the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.
