    "text": " 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I could think of it as the entire expansion being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because any term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because if I do that, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^{6} = 64\\), but that would give 6 * 64 = 384, which is way too big. So, I must have made a mistake in that reasoning. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning where I thought it should be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but the original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Wait, does that mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). But that would be 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would be 384, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable and collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in algebra typically means the coefficient when you consider all variables, so if there are other variables, you have to consider them as well. So, for example, if you have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But if you're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not the case. I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, and the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems inconsistent with standard terminology. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product, it's implied that you consider all variables, so you'd need to specify the exponents of all variables. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). That suggests that we're to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the product of coefficients. That is, for each term in the second expansion, multiply by 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion) and sum them up. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem wants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Given that, I think the intended answer is 120, because otherwise, the problem would have specified that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Since it didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm by considering an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 0 because there's no such term. But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a^1c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 1 (from \\(a c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a/c\\)) = 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, if we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression, but the question is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, after all that, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
