Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.
