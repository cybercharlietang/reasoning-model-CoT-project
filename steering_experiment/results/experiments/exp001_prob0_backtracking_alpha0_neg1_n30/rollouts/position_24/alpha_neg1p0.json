So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 * 6 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be a product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term where you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second, because any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the variables involved. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.

So, let's work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by the constant term (which is 20) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, yes, the coefficients multiply. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me consider the entire expansion. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20. So, multiplying these two, you get 6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I had to write the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, because the \\(c\\) terms are all multiplied by other terms, but since we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we can ignore the \\(c\\) parts because they would create terms with \\(c\\) exponents, which we don't have in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can compute the entire expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient. But that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), so the constant term is indeed 20. So, when I multiply that by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term 6a^2b^2, then the product will have a term 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think about the exponents. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, when you take m terms of \\(1/c\\), each contributing a \\(c^{-1}\\), and 6 - m terms of \\(c\\), each contributing \\(c^1\\), the total exponent is \\( (6 - m) - m = 6 - 2m\\). Setting that equal to 0, we get m = 3, which gives the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of 6 and 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the other expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

    "text": " So, I think that's the key here. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only be affected by the constant term in the second expression. So, let me first confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for the second part, we need the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(c^0\\), because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that it? Let me just double-check. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.

    "text": " So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, let me work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we only care about the terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\), and no \\(c\\) terms, that's only when we take the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that would give 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   Since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
