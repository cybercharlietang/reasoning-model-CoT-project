For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only the terms from the second part that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because any \\(c\\) term would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) factor, which would not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the term where the second factor is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that's not the case. Wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by all the terms from the second polynomial. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur when the second factor is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by another term. For example, if I took a term with \\(c^1\\) and multiplied it by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\), would that give me \\(c^0\\)? But in this case, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term. Any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms. Therefore, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another sanity check: Let me compute the entire product for a simpler case to see if the logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute it. The first part is \\(a + b\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together gives \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 1 (since the second part doesn't have a constant term). But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c\\), which is a variable, not a constant. Wait, that seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe my earlier reasoning was flawed.\n\nWait, no, in that simple case, the product is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). There is no constant term (without \\(c\\)) in the product, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is actually \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a variable, not a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not simply the product of the coefficients, because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. So, in our original problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, which is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) by the constant term (20), we get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the simple case, since the second polynomial didn't have a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is a variable, not a constant. So, in our problem, since the second polynomial does have a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think my earlier reasoning is correct.\n\nWait, but in the simple case, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in that product, it's not a constant; it's a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in our original problem, since the second polynomial has a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant, 120. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The expression \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid.

So, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
