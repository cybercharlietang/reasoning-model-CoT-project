    "text": " \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI think the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think that when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, so the coefficient just gets scaled by the entire second expansion's total. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their exponents are independent. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you just add up all those coefficients to the original coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in other words, if I let \\(C_1\\) be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and \\(C_2\\) be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(C_1 \\times C_2\\). \n\nNow, I need to find \\(C_2\\), the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\) into the polynomial because that will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, \\(C_2 = 64\\). \n\nNow, going back to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's \\(C_1 \\times C_2 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and you multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then actually, every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. \n\nSo, 6 multiplied by 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me double-check my steps. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: correct, and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. \n\n3. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), all the coefficients from the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\n4. Therefore, compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion by substituting \\(c = 1\\), getting 64. \n\n5. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384. \n\nYes, that all seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Evaluate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum from the second part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating each term, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. Since multiplication is involved, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be affected by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I guess I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which will result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), depending on the term. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) must cancel out to give a constant term (since otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\)). \n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, I get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. If I multiply it by any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which isn't what we're looking for. \n\nSo, that means I need to find two things:\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let me work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means I need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check that factorial calculation. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36. So, 720 \u00f7 36 is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, the total coefficient in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only affected by the constant term in the second expansion? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) in it. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as two separate expansions and then multiplying the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. But I think the approach I took is correct. The key idea is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, only the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two individual coefficients.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to:\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to:\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} = 20\\) (which is the constant term)\n- \\(15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The only term that will result in a term without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The key was recognizing that only the constant term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. All other terms would introduce a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Simplifying the binomial coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, actually, that's not quite right. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. However, actually, every term in the second expansion will have some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nNo, that might not be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression is multiplied by another expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it will still have \\(a^2b^2\\), but if we multiply it by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, by the sum of the coefficients of the constant terms in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well for the terms that combine to give the same variables. So, yeah, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first expand each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Expanding using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion I just did, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. \n\nHmm, does the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the ways that when I multiply terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term has \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me break this down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, right? Because if it's not a constant term, it would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, to get the final coefficient. \n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\nSubtract 6 from both sides: \\(-2k = -6\\)\nDivide both sides by -2: \\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute that again. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. Since these are being multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. \n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and since we're multiplying by the constant term in the other expansion, which is 20, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe are looking for the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second part won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is being multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate expansion. Actually, I think I might be overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the entire product, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in terms that include \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, I need to consider both parts together.\n\nSo, let's approach this step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which we already did: it's 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) from the second part. So, the product will have terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut we're interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which means that term will be a constant (with respect to \\(c\\)) and will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Now, let's find the coefficient for that term. The coefficient from the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6! / (3! * (6 - 3)!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, the term from the first part is 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part when \\(m=3\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c\\) terms, is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of the two coefficients. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Since the second expansion's \\(c^0\\) term is 20, as we calculated, and the first part's coefficient is 6, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

That gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. Okay, so far so good.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, actually, the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then consider how it's affected by the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion would contribute to the overall coefficient by multiplying each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression also involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and sum their coefficients, then multiply by 6. But that seems too large.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but focusing only on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part and summing over all the possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I believe. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion? Or is it that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Yes, that's correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then you would sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then you would take the coefficient from the first part (6) and multiply by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. Let me check that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. If I consider the entire product, it's a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.

But since it's not specified, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of 1 in the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have a constant term unless we're considering the sum of all coefficients. Hmm, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about it in terms of variables. The expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the entire second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the question is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I need to find the coefficient when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, actually, maybe not. Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. The \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will just contribute a factor that gets multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the part involving \\(c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the expression is considered as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just 6 times whatever the entire second part is. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, that can't be right because the question is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would still mean the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, ignoring the \\(c\\) part. That seems odd, but maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But then, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but I don't know.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the two parts are \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by every possible term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient of that term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, treating all variables together, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the part with \\(c\\) is multiplied by the entire term, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of the \\(c\\) part is. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. So, maybe the answer is 6.\n\nBut that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times \\(c\\) and 2 times \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(2c + 2/c\\). But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in this example, the coefficient is actually \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is not a number, but an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, so in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term of the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that seems plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, multiply these two together to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm correct. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 120, and that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term and just took the entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. So, I think the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in the second expansion when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but why do we consider only the constant term? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and if we include other terms from the second expansion, those would introduce \\(c\\) terms, making the overall term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\). So, that's why we need the constant term.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term: when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms.

But that seems like it would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but the problem is that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients don't interfere.

Let me check that. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nOkay, that seems plausible. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's equal to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so multiplying them gives 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's not just 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, because that would make the coefficient a polynomial. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is likely asking for a specific coefficient, so probably the one where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. Specifically, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me calculate those coefficients. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, so the first term is \\(1 \\cdot a^4\\). \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\). \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4, so the fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\), and finally, \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1, giving \\(1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. \n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is involved, when I expand the entire expression, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect that coefficient. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure.\n\nActually, when we multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms contributes a coefficient, and all of them get multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the original coefficient times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), you have to consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. \n\nBut actually, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all the terms that result from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), it's actually just the coefficient 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial in \\(c\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that may have any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But actually, no, the coefficient in an expression is a number, not a term with variables. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, they want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which may be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) will have coefficients, and we need to sum all those coefficients to get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each of those terms has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients are separate for different variables. \n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in different variables. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials with different variables, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the variables are different, the terms don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are supposed to be constants. \n\nWait, I'm really confused now. Maybe I should think of it as a product of two separate expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which is not a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we need to sum all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured such that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's in different variables. So, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and we need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, we would have to consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms has a coefficient, say \\(k\\), and a power of \\(c\\), so the result is \\(6k a^2b^2 c^n\\), where \\(n\\) is some integer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these \\(6k\\) terms, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, to find this, I need to calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let me think. When you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, multiplying that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply it by the second polynomial, which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, the result is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients in this expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of these coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then in the product, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not what the question is asking. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the"

Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a minute, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of coefficients is in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the second part could have multiple terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this expansion. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6. We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and in the second expansion, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20c^0\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would change the term we're looking for. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I think I can consider the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just a constant with respect to the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat the second expansion as a constant when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but when considering the entire product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the same as in the first expansion, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that can't be because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we can treat the entire second expansion as a single coefficient for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can just take the coefficient from the first expansion and multiply it by the entire second expansion. But that seems incorrect because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the product would have terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\text{sum of all coefficients from the second expansion}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different \\(c\\) powers, each with their own coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion with coefficient 6. When we multiply by the second expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum, not a single term. \n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify: when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I think I'm making a mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not quite right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), the second expansion becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient in a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which contradicts the problem statement. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can treat the second factor as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second factor is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. As I thought before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6. But that seems too simple. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 multiplied by the entire second expansion, so \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be the same. But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve terms with \\(c\\). But the problem states \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. \n\nSo, let's approach it that way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nThat makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term \\(20\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait, to make sure, let me go through the steps again. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: we get terms including \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. I was confused earlier about whether the problem wanted the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), but now I see that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, which implies that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. That means I have to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I can ignore the second part since it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? Wait, no, because when I multiply the two expressions, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can consider that term separately.\n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as I found earlier, which is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, but we need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero? Or perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire expansion, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just need the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that seems complicated because \\(c\\) is involved in the second part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, find all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and sum up their coefficients. Or, maybe it's just the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) and the other variables as separate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since they are separate variables, when you multiply them, the terms don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the original coefficient times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term of \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^k\\) term would be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the coefficient from \\(Q(c)\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would have to sum over all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) would contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q(c)\\) gives the sum of its coefficients. Let me check that. If \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(P(a, b)\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)), giving 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I might be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but specifically, perhaps the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, if we just multiply by the sum of all coefficients, we're effectively treating \\(c\\) as 1, which might not be the intended interpretation.\n\nSo, let me consider that approach. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (from \\(c + 1/c\\)), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384, but now I'm thinking that maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, I need to clarify what exactly the problem is asking. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we would have to sum all these products. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, if we're only looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems a bit counterintuitive because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, let me test this with a smaller example to see if I'm correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But actually, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. Wait, so maybe my initial approach is wrong. \n\nWait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be zero because in \\(ac + a/c\\), there's no constant term. But in the original problem, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the only term that would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) is when we multiply by the constant term from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. That would make sense, and in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial), giving 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120, while the other coefficients are for terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without mentioning other variables, it's implied that you consider the term where the other variables' exponents are zero. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. \n\nSo, to summarize"

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another term, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Or do I? Hmm, let me think.\n\nActually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them out, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. \n\nSo, let's break this down. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, does that mean I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nI think it means that we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expression, because each term in the second expression will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384, as I thought earlier. But let's see.\n\nWait, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expression). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's the first interpretation: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expression and multiplying by 6. \n\nBut let me confirm. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is being multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nThe sum of coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider all possible ways that term can be formed. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate products. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expression, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the term in the second expression where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then multiplied by 6 gives 120. \n\nWait, so maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out, which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would involve finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then multiplying by 6, giving 120. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me look up similar problems to see how they interpret such questions. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two polynomials, if the term involves variables from both polynomials, you have to consider their exponents. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, it's the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6*20=120. \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\)) would only be the term where the second factor is the constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k=0\\), which is the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m=3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so I think I was confused earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6*20=120. \n\nSo, the final answer is 120. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that contradicts the earlier result. So, which one is correct? \n\nI think the confusion is about whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 384. \n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nBut the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSince it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut wait, in that case, when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, and then 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if you don't set \\(c = 1\\), and you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which includes all terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 384. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's considered as the sum of all coefficients when that variable is set to zero. But in this case, \\(c\\) is separate, so maybe it's different. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in P is multiplied by every term in Q, so the coefficient becomes the product of the coefficients. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)), which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 times (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the"

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, how does that interact with the first part? I think I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, actually, let me think again. \n\nWait, no. The second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient in the first part is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, that means the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, actually, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But actually, no, that's not quite right because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the second doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to find the coefficient of the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that's different. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (which is 20), so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, as I did before, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion as a product and think about how the terms combine. But I think the method I used is correct because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, each term is a multiple of some power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's being multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But since the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's considering all possible powers? That seems unclear.\n\nWait, no, actually, in such problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), they usually mean the coefficient when considering all variables. But in this case, the expression is a product of two separate binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nSo, let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720/36 = 20. Wait, no, that's not right. 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) is 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me see if there's another approach. Alternatively, we can consider the entire expansion as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and any term from the second expansion will multiply it. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, my initial approach was correct: we need to find the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We found those to be 6 and 20, respectively, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is just for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part. However, when I multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I might get more terms, and I need to make sure I'm looking at the right term. \n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when I multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, does that mean I'm supposed to treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient? \n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each in different variables. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) will all be present. \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by any term in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we're supposed to treat it as a separate part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) come from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first part. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by the entire expansion, you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion, and the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6 from the first part. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, every time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, it's effectively scaling the coefficient, and the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by any term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I calculated earlier. The sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that any power of \\(c\\) is acceptable. In that case, the coefficient would still be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) will be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. But looking at the actual product, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 for \\(a^2c\\) and 1 for \\(a^2/c\\), but if we're just considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then each occurrence of \\(a^2\\) is scaled by the coefficient from the second expansion. So, in total, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you look at the product, each term involving \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by a coefficient, but if you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually 1 for each term, so the total coefficient would be 2. So, in this small example, the approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another thought: in the original problem, the variables are separate, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression is a product of two polynomials, each in different variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0, so that the term is just a constant. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let's recast the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nIn that case, we can break it down into two parts: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and second, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem was actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the final answer is 120. \n\nLet me verify this with another approach. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this also needs to be expanded, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to expand this part. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider any terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. So, actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by the first part, will contribute a term that includes \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) somehow cancel out to 0? Or maybe the problem is just treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we're to consider the coefficient in the entire expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense either. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expansion of the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and we need the coefficient for that specific term. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So perhaps it's just 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would include terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. That would be 6. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", so it's the product of both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would result in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just 6, considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is there to test if I'm paying attention. But that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nLet me verify this. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to various terms, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, but wait, no, the entire expression is a product of these two parts. So, maybe I need to consider the coefficients from both expansions and see how they multiply together. But hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^{m}}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). We want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which as before gives us the term from the first part as \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Now, this term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) is the exponent for \\(c\\) in the second term. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\) for any \\(n\\), and sum them up? Or is the problem only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? \n\nI think it's the latter. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients. But wait, actually, in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion. When I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let me calculate that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that logic again. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term has a coefficient, say \\(C_m\\), and a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(C_m\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, each term in the product will be \\(a^{2}b^{2}c^{n}\\) with some coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients \\(C_m\\) from the second expansion, because each term \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\) has coefficient \\(6 \\times C_m\\), but when we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(C_m\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. Because each term in the product will be \\(a^{2}b^{2}c^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) is \\(6 \\times C_k\\), where \\(C_k\\) is the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients for all possible \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k} C_k\\). And as I thought before, \\(\\sum_{k} C_k\\) is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. The first expansion has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are separate variables, the multiplication would indeed result in terms that are products of the terms from each expansion. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we sum all those contributions. \n\nSo, I think my reasoning holds. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. Each term in this expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, for each \\(m\\), we have different exponents. Let me list them out:\n\n- When \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- When \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- When \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- When \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\)\n- When \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\), etc. However, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, we're looking for all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each of these products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first factor, right? Because the second factor is only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially taking each term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), etc. So, each of these terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that's independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nLet me check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, including the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily multiplied by any specific power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but each time it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first expansion, but when multiplied by the second expansion, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think about how the product works. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3b \\times 6c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2}\\), etc.\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once, but it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (the constant term).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we expand this, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first expansion as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, we also have the term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but if we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nBut let me just make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire original expression is this expansion multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), I might need to figure out how that part interacts. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients in the first part are independent of the second part. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how the terms combine. \n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire second part, and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. \n\nWait, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term in the second polynomial. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as part of a combined term, and \\(c\\) is separate. But in that case, the coefficient would still be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the binomial theorem. Let me check the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. \n\nThen, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. \n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, yes, the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to collect like terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so it's effectively 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by terms in \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but as a coefficient, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), it's like we're considering the product where the \\(c\\) terms are all summed together, hence the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer if I think of it as follows: The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes 64, as before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem isn't setting \\(c = 1\\), it's just asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which is the same as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, let's see, \\(4 - k = 2\\) which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. \n\nWell, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are affected by the coefficients in both expressions. However, in this case, the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that means we need the term where the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., a constant term, since \\(c^0 = 1\\)). Because if it contributes any other power of \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply those two parts together, the \\(c^0\\) term will just contribute a constant, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression. \n\nAlright, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that's 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are being multiplied together, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems unnecessarily complicated. I think the method I used is correct because I'm considering the separate contributions from each part of the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, their variables don't interfere with each other, so the coefficients multiply when looking for a specific term that doesn't involve the other variables. \n\nJust to double-check, let me think about the multiplication. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\), and I multiply each of these by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(20c^0\\), I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). All the other terms when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) would involve some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating each term, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that this term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem quite right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not exactly correct either. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when I expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) come from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c^m (1/c)^n = c^{m - n}\\), each term will have some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without considering its exponent. Hmm, that seems a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would include all the terms from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me check. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, if I multiply that by 6, I get 6 * 64 = 384. So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression 384?\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we also need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That is, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nIn that case, I would need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's see. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, what is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? \n\nTo find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm confused now because the problem might be interpreted in two ways: either considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent or specifically looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another polynomial in \\(c\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because when you multiply by a polynomial, you're distributing each term. So, perhaps another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). \n\nWait, that makes sense. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\), so in this case, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought maybe it's 120 when considering \\(c^0\\), but that's only if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can have any \\(c\\) term, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but that seems like it's not a single number.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are convolutions of the coefficients of the factors. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a term in the first polynomial, and then multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the entire second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) condition, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I should interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me see if I can find a definitive answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific number.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, \\(c^m \\times c^{-n} = c^{m - n}\\), and we want \\(m - n = 0\\), so \\(m = n\\). But in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm still not sure. Maybe I should consider both interpretations.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in multivariable polynomials. The coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is a number, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying \\(c\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the"

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, so maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the terms from the second polynomial. Hmm, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the terms from each part will combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that term from the first part and how it interacts with the second part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, it will just add a factor of that term's coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the other part is multiplied by it, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6? Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then I think I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all the terms. But since the second part only involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, but no, because the second part is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it's like scaling each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by that entire polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the entire expression gives \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first polynomial times each term in the second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply, you have to consider all the terms.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same expression, but since they're separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me verify this by expanding a bit more. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), which is the same as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} 6 \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from each term, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Because in the product, each term is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually not a single number but rather a sum over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose instead of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we had \\((a + b)^1\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the product would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 1*2=2. But actually, expanding it, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if we were to look for the coefficient of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1, summing to 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, which would require considering all powers of \\(c\\), effectively treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should go back to the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients of terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in"

Calculating those binomial coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so that's the first part. Now, the second part of the original expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part interacts with the first expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first expansion, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is present. Now, I need to consider how this term is multiplied by terms from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait a second, actually, when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would change the variables, right? So, only the constant term (the term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 as the constant term. Multiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that only the constant term from the second expansion affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, which we don't want. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nWait, but the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't stop here because I also have to consider the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, how does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nI think I need to consider the entire expression as a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect that part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\). \n\nSo, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to the term where \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then this term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), and so on. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when expanded, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is a positive integer. So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part of the product doesn't interact with the \\(c\\) terms in the second part. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded form, considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k=2\\), and for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some polynomial}\\). When I multiply them together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first expansion, and the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum over all terms in the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k=2\\), and for each \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because for each \\(m\\), the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and from the second expansion, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut wait, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)), times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. \n\nWait, so maybe my approach is wrong. Let me think again. In the example, \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion has terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^k b^{2 - k}\\) times \\(c^m (1/c)^{1 - m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k=2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, \\(b^2\\) is present as a separate term. So, when you multiply \\(b^2\\) by the second expansion, you get terms like \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term in the product. But according to my earlier reasoning, I would have thought it's 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, that means my approach is flawed. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to reconsider. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k=2\\) and \\(4 - k=2\\), so \\(k=2\\). So, the coefficient from the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the term from the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), according to this method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{1} \\dbinom{1}{m} = 1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. So, why the discrepancy? \n\nAh, I see. Because in the first example, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present. So, the coefficient is zero. But according to my method, I get 2, which is wrong. So, my method is flawed. \n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let me check. In the first example, \\((a + b)^2\\) does not have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero. But according to my method, I calculated \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{1} \\dbinom{1}{m} = 1 \\times 2 = 2\\), which is incorrect. \n\nSo, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should only consider the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, which requires that in the first expansion, the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, it's a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But that's not possible because the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion by a term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second expansion only has terms involving \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this"

Calculating the coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is right there in the expansion as 6. But wait, the entire expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because any other term from the second expansion would involve powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and the second expansion's constant term is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the binomial coefficients. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the terms in the second expansion that result in a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nSo, first, let me focus on finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what I'm looking for. \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, since I'm multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving me 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion. Since these are independent, their coefficients multiply when considering the entire expression. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer.

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left( \\text{some expression in } c \\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the overall coefficient. \n\nBut actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the actual powers of \\(c\\) don't matter. So, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. So, when multiplied together, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about it another way. Alternatively, I could expand both expressions separately and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when you consider all terms, their coefficients add up to 64, so 6 * 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part can contribute any power of \\(c\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's like we're considering the constant term in the second expression. Wait, but no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of coefficients. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part is the middle term of the expansion, which would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, that's different. So, now I'm confused. \n\nWait, so which is it? Is the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, or 6 * 20 = 120? Hmm. Let me clarify. \n\nIf I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I need to consider that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficients. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 * sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, since it's \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. \n\nBut if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2, which is 1 * 2. So, in that case, it's correct. So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part, and multiply them. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the power of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nOkay, so that confirms it. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nI was initially confused because I thought maybe I needed to find the constant term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means we have to sum over all possible coefficients in the second expansion, which gives us 64, and then multiply by 6, giving 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating those coefficients, we get \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose this is another binomial expansion. Let me expand that as well. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where m goes from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, I need to find all terms where the power of a is 2 and the power of b is 2. But wait, in the first part, the terms are in a and b, and in the second part, the terms are in c and 1/c. So, the variables c and 1/c don't affect the powers of a and b. That means, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply the terms, I want the powers of c to cancel out so that the term doesn't have any c in it. Because the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without c. \n\nWait, no, actually, when I'm multiplying the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since I'm interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the exponents of a and b. That is, any term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second expansion only has c terms, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the c terms. So, that would mean that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but I don't think that's correct. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply by a term from the second part, you're adding a factor that depends on c. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in c, so each term would contribute a different power of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of c.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where a is squared and b is squared, regardless of what's happening with c. So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the terms from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), but the coefficient for each of these would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum over all m of (coefficient from first part) times (coefficient from second part). But wait, in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, does that mean that the coefficient is the sum of all these 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6? Wait, that can't be right because that would be 6 times the sum of all binomial coefficients for n=6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's correct because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in different terms, each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part evaluated at c^0, because only the term where c^0 would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c term. So, perhaps it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of c, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial will contribute a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial is in c and 1/c, and the first polynomial is in a and b, the variables are separate. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, does that mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part? Because each term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when c=1, so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. So, in that case, I would need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of c is 0. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. \n\nSo, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming c^0) is 120. \n\nBut just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. There are no other combinations because the first polynomial only has terms in a and b, and the second only in c and 1/c. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. Now, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. However, since the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nLet me think about this. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents of different variables add independently. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form (something with a and b) times (something with c and 1/c). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in other words, we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of c. \n\nBut actually, since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from each multiplication. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me consider how polynomial multiplication works. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b)) multiplied by (sum of coefficients in Q(c)).\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is found by setting c = 1. So, if I let c = 1 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would give me the sum of coefficients, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c, not a single number. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of c. That is, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of c. \n\nBut in that case, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's (ac + a/c), so the coefficient is (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also (c + 1/c). So, in this case, the coefficients are not just the sum, but they include the c terms. But in the problem, we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, ignoring the c terms. But that doesn't make sense because the product includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which is 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes c, but perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient as a polynomial in c. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c. Wait, that can't be, because in the product, every term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of c. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify c, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that we're looking for all terms in the product where a is squared and b is squared, and then sum their coefficients. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating c as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting just the numerical coefficient, ignoring the c terms. But that doesn't make sense because the c terms are part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a different approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20c^0 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + 1c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all these coefficients for all powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1). Let's calculate that: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, 6*64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 6*20 = 120, since the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying c, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about what the product looks like. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from each multiplication. Since each multiplication is 6 times the coefficient of each term in the second expansion, the total is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
