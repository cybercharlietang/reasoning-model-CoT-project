    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial coefficients, which are the same as the 4th row of Pascal's triangle: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, expanding that, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present here with a coefficient of 6. That seems straightforward. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of this expansion and another expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps we are supposed to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms will involve products like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - m}\\) (since the second expansion will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), etc., down to \\(c^0 = 1\\) and then up to \\(c^{-6}\\)). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the second expression, we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, but that seems too high, and I might be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But the way the question is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. Let me check again. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in the second expansion. Because otherwise, if \\(c\\) is involved, then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would just be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but only when \\(c^m\\) is such that it's a constant term. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both expressions separately and then multiply them, focusing only on the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nFirst, as I did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I was supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but now I'm thinking that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nHmm, so which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, that would imply that the coefficient includes all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression, which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial, so perhaps the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nSo, to find that, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I found earlier, that occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I expand the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), and \\(1\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1 = 6a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients for all \\(k\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's just \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's a bit ambiguous. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond interpretation: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 120, because if it were asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would probably specify that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would typically imply the term where the exponents of all other variables are zero. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different example. Let me try another one. \n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)("

Okay, so that's the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I guess I need to expand this as well, but wait, do I need to? Because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to multiply the entire expansions together, but instead, just find the part that affects \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in order to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, I need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if I take \\(6a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by, say, a term with \\(c^k\\), then the result will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term that is only \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, I set the exponent equal to zero and solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Plugging that into the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the constant term from the other expansion is 20. So, when I multiply these two together, I get:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, I used the binomial theorem correctly on both parts. For \\((a + b)^4\\), I correctly identified the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I found the constant term by setting the exponent equal to zero, which gave me \\(k = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. \n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by expanding both expressions fully and then looking for the term, but that seems more time-consuming. Alternatively, I could think about the entire product and realize that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the product of the corresponding terms from each binomial expansion, which is exactly what I did. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yep, that's right. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct as well. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nWait, but the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only dependent on the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in an expression is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expression is being multiplied by each term in the first expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Since each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me expand both expressions separately and then see how the terms combine. \n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is as I wrote before: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me consider another approach. Suppose I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), where \\(P(a, b)\\) is the first polynomial and \\(Q(c)\\) is the second. Then, when you multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in \\(Q(c)\\) and then adding them all up. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Let me compute it manually. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then each term becomes 1, and the sum is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just multiplied by each term in the second part, and since each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. But let me just go through it one more time to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of all coefficients by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\n3. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Set \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term from that expansion will involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion would be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the product of any term from the first expansion with any term from the second will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents as well as \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) exponents. \n\nWait, but the question is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term must come from the part of the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of a term from each polynomial, so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) come only from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a factor that is multiplied by it. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that's not the case because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial for \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is a separate factor. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form (term from first expansion) \u00d7 (term from second expansion). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have the form 6\\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or 6\\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), depending on the term. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only appear in the product when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if you multiply by any term that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nThe constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in the second polynomial is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the constant term comes only from the second polynomial. So, when you multiply them, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, but that's not correct because the second polynomial's terms have variables, so only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. \n\nWait, no, actually, if I consider that the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), its expansion will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will be \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), except when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, that confirms that the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed in only one way from the first polynomial, which is by choosing two \\(a\\)s and two \\(b\\)s, and the rest of the terms in the product will come from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which contradicts my earlier result. So, I must have made a mistake here. \n\nWait, no, that approach is wrong because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, but that's when you consider all terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, but only the term that has \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second polynomial will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think my initial approach was correct, and the confusion came when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which isn't the right approach because only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, giving a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20 using the binomial theorem. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me calculate those coefficients. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1. So, expanding it, we get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. \n\nHmm, I think that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, all the terms from the second expression will just get multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't include any \\(c\\) terms, we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but no, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe I'm misapplying the concept. \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nWait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check by actually expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's see, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) as a single term, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, it just gets scaled by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, yes, I think 384 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient in the second part is 1 when considering only \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. The expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n3. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) will expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the product where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. \n\nWait, but actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the thing is, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something else, which doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product, but wait, actually, no. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient adds up.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only if the variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interact. That is, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will multiply every term in the second polynomial, but each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But wait, that can't be right because the second polynomial is a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the two polynomials are in different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial, if there is one. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. But the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that and see if there's a constant term. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), stepping by powers of \\(c^{-1}\\) each time. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, there is a constant term when the exponent is 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second polynomial, the constant term is 20. When you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, but only the constant term in the second polynomial will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms from the second polynomial will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we identify the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write out the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial coefficients, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The coefficients for each term can be found using combinations. The coefficients for \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\) are 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1 respectively. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in this expansion, that's the term with coefficient 6. But hold on, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nHmm, so the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will depend on the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, since we're multiplying two polynomials together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. \n\nBut in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider the entire expansion?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each resulting term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Because if it's the latter, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nI think that's the case. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which introduces terms with different powers of \\(c\\), I think the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that term would just be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^0 \\text{ in } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to compute two things: \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, I multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as per the binomial expansion.\n\nSecond, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, does that mean it's considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? Or does it specifically mean \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\)? \n\nHmm, in algebra, when we talk about the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, it's usually considering the term with that exact combination of variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), that might mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial would contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). \n\nBut the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut now I'm confused because the problem could be interpreted in two ways: either it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's asking for all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be an infinite series if \\(c\\) can be any power, but in reality, the second polynomial only has finite terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nWait, but even so, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by each of those. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply by each term, each term contributes its own coefficient to the product. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, it's a bit ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial, which are different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which might not be what the problem is asking for. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut to make sure, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, as we calculated earlier. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which is 384. \n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have specified that it wants the sum over all powers of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, it's a bit unclear. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the product, the variables are independent, so \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it would create terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by it. \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. \n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. \n\nSo, in this case, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all combinations of terms from the first polynomial and the second polynomial that multiply together to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of"

That means I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6, as we saw from the expansion. But the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nI think the key here is to realize that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, but only for terms that have the same variables. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because multiplying by them would introduce variables \\(c\\) into the term, which we don't have in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), then the resulting term would be \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But since we're only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), and without any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't change the term. \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again for this. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the term that will give us \\(c^0 = 1\\). \n\nSo, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). Let's compute that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2(3)} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expression is 20. \n\nSo, multiplying these together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, the key steps were:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want.\n3. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20 when \\(k = 3\\).\n4. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and realize that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is indeed 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning, so I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their coefficients shouldn't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to have \\(c^0\\) from the second part. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the only way that the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because otherwise, the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these are independent, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the correct coefficient. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

But since this is multiplied by the second expression, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is independent of the second expansion because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided the variables match appropriately. But in this case, the first expression has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression by a term in the second expression that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, which we don't want.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression that are multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), it will result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, let me compute that again to be sure. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is that all? Let me just double-check my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6*20=120 in the entire product.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term where the second expression contributes a constant, so that the variables don't change. Hence, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 120.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me just verify the binomial coefficients again quickly.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting exponent to 0 gives k=3, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, up to \\(a^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Similarly, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we are looking for the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). However, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, because it's multiplied by all the terms of the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad, because the coefficient of a term in a product is typically a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, what is the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right either, because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial where each term is 6 times the corresponding term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. Wait, no, because in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so each of those would be separate terms, each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number, unless we're considering the coefficient as the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial where each term is 6 times the corresponding term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think of the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) stands alone without any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0 = 1\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). To find this, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me calculate it properly:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier by assuming the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but that would require summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would again give 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384, which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous unless it's specified whether it's considering all powers of \\(c\\) or just the constant term. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that's the expansion of the first part. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first part. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nLet me write down the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expressions, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait a second, but the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That is, the terms in the first polynomial (which are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) will each be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables in each term will just be the product of the variables from each part. \n\nSo, for example, \\(a^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will give terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc., but none of these will have any \\(b\\) terms. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) times the second expansion will give terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc., but again, these won't have \\(a^2b^2\\) because they have \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in the first polynomial has a different power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), and when multiplied by the second polynomial, which only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those other terms won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and wants the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and when expanded, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient is the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should include the \\(c\\) terms as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and thus the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But again, that would give me an expression in terms of \\(c\\), not a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire product is expanded, treating all variables as separate. But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient when multiplied out, but only considering the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) sum to zero. So, to find that, I need to first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nSo, let me proceed step by step. First, I need to find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me calculate it properly:\n\n\\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, multiplying these together:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, gives 6 * 20 = 120, so the term is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, and just multiplied the entire expansion, I would have 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would give a coefficient of 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that seems like an expression, not a number. So, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, but that's an expression, not a number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). But actually, no, because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify. If I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the product \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^k\\) would result in terms that have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial. But in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is there a constant term? Let's check.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be a constant, the exponent on \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the constant term is 20, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term. The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). \n\nLet me think. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the entire second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the variables are different. So, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me clarify. \n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, none of the terms in the second part will affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is an expression, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut how do I find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nOh, wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nSo, let's correct that. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which equals 120. \n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier conclusion. So, I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, I only need the constant term in the second expansion because that's the only term that will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only combine with the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part to produce a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part would result in terms that include \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. The first expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when \\(k=3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nI think my initial confusion was thinking that the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is needed, but actually, only the constant term is relevant because we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I should stick with 120 as the coefficient. \n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these, you get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, etc., but the only term that results in just a\u00b2b\u00b2 is when you multiply by 20, giving 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. All other terms have additional factors of c or 1/c, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the binomial coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSince the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the overall expansion will involve terms from both expansions multiplied together. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider all the ways that when I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the exponent of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come solely from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the exponent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the other part. \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, does that mean that any term in the expansion where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts give \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient, and the \\(c\\) part can be anything? Or does the entire term need to be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which I think means the coefficient when considering all terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will get multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges depending on the expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P(a, b)\\) by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify. Suppose \\(Q(c)\\) has terms \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). When I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get \\(a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 15a^2b^2c^2 + 20a^2b^2 + 15a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the problem, the question is just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Does that mean they are considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or do they mean \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\)? I think it's the former because otherwise, they would specify a particular power of \\(c\\). So, if they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it just adds a factor of that term's coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? \n\nI remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Wait, no, actually, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about it differently, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but is that accurate? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial where the variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, I think my earlier calculation is correct. The coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach to be sure. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6. So, for each \\(m\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWe know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, that seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute it step by step without using the sum of coefficients, I could expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply each term by \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum the coefficients. But that's essentially the same as what I did earlier. \n\nWait, another way: The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that's a quick way to find that sum. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Recognize that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n4. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n5. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384.\n\nYes, that all makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts of the expression. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect that. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other terms.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied together. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the other expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) only if the other term is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)). But in reality, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponents cancel out.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we can treat the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms separately. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms would create a new term in the product, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself isn't being multiplied by any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\); rather, each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) parts don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. So, maybe the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem mentions both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, I think I was overcomplicating earlier. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^{2k}}\\) or something like that? Wait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient, and \\(c\\) is a variable, unless \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is a constant term (i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\)), which would mean \\(m = 3\\). So, only the term where \\(m = 3\\) would contribute to the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term) will result in a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nLet me verify that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, when you multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) attached. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (i.e., term with \\(c^0\\)) which is 20. Therefore, when multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're interested in the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means I have to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient when multiplied together. \n\nHmm, so maybe I need to expand both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply them, looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, actually, the variables in the two parts are different: one part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think that any term in the expansion that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but only the terms that are constants, because if you have a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would make the term in the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, I think that might not be the case. Let me think again. The original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), and any power of \\(c\\) is allowed. Wait, no, actually, no, because the variables are separate. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but the second part has \\(c\\) terms, so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, but in the product, it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit odd because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be a very large number, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and any term from the second expression, because when you multiply, the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we would sum all the coefficients from the second expression and multiply by 6. \n\nBut let me check: is that the case? Let's say the second expression is expanded as a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's the first case: we need to sum over all coefficients in the second expansion and multiply by 6. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of multiple terms in the product, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nLet me test this idea. Let's compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. So, each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each coefficient from the second expansion is multiplied by 6 and attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's the same as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut let me check this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. \n\nWait, but in reality, the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong. \n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), not 2. So, perhaps I was wrong in thinking that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (term from second expansion). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to a constant. But that's not specified in the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's only considering the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nLet me check that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write out the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the coefficients will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\). Calculating those, I get 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1. So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But hold on, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. So, the entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we just need to consider the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nSo, perhaps I should first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try that. Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nWait, so the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion that isn't a constant term would introduce a power of \\(c\\) into the product, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about this is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without having a constant term from the second part. So, yes, I think 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{terms involving } c\\text{ and }1/c\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen I multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, that gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That means we can treat the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), as a separate expansion and see how it interacts with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire expression, would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will add a factor involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single term.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. But that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be a sum of terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^4\\), etc. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nNow, what's the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. So, when you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) * Q(c) is the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of the term in P is scaled by each coefficient in Q, and since we're summing over all terms in Q, the total scaling factor is the sum of the coefficients in Q.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the structure of the product. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the variables are multiplied as well. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), and similarly for other terms.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be, because in the product, every term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, there is no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to compute the product of the coefficients from both expansions for that specific \\(k\\). But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Therefore, when multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can treat the second expansion as a scalar multiple of the first expansion's coefficients. So, the total coefficient is just the product of the individual coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, and we're summing over all possible combinations that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\).\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I need. The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient I found, 6, is the final answer? Hmm, maybe not. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient doesn't get affected by the second part. \n\nWait, let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that means I need the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, that's the only way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product. \n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, that's not right. Let me check the calculation again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part gives me a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second expansion contributes a constant term of 20. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives me 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the constant term in the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct. \n\nSo, combining the two coefficients, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) to get the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, it should be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, if I were just looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient would be 6. But in the given problem, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but hold on. When we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will get multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the multiplication by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of the coefficients from all those multiplications. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression, but that seems too broad. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since I only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything\u2014they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might be correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\) or something, but when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nWait, but is that accurate? Because each term in \\(Q\\) is a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let's compute \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\nQ(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check this again. Because when I expand \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\(P = (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which has a total of 64 when \\(c=1\\), so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose \\(P = (a + b)^1 = a + b\\) and \\(Q = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Then, the product is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's just 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which makes sense because when you set \\(c=1\\), you get \\(a + a/c + b c + b/c\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems to work. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. \n\nSo, applying the same logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), but that might not be the right way. Wait, no, because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c\\) to some power. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\), each multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, so 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, set \\(c=1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get 6a^2b^2 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider specific terms, maybe I could think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since each term in \\(Q\\) is multiplied by it, the total contribution is 6 times each term in \\(Q\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from \\(Q\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, I think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the coefficients multiply. \n\nFrom earlier, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the powers \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), respectively. \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each of the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^3b c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), etc. \n\nBut when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only care about the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c=1\\), which is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The expansion is:\n"

So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\times 1 \\times b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, so the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because each term in the second expansion could potentially affect the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the product are found by multiplying the coefficients of each term and then adding them up where the variables match. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you have two separate products, like \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first product is multiplied by each term in the second product. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and every term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, as the variables don't interfere.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let me compute that.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because I'm assuming that each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply and add when the exponents add up. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because when you multiply by any power of \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those products will have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire product as two separate parts: the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) terms. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by every term in the second part. Each of those terms will have some coefficient and a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each of those multiplications will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, which gives 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Suppose I expand both parts fully and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The first part, as I did before, is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the \\(a^4\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^{6}\\), \\(a^4c^{4}\\), etc. Similarly, the \\(a^3b\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^3bc^{6}\\), \\(a^3bc^{4}\\), etc. The term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all the products where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), any term in the second expansion will not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion. Each such multiplication will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. As we calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me just double-check my reasoning. When you have two separate variables in the two parts of the product, the exponents of one set of variables don't affect the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Hmm, that means I have to consider the expansion of the second part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait a second, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients in the product will be multiplied by the coefficients from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied, not added. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but only considering the constant term (if any) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is in terms of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply it by the term that has \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second expansion. Because if we multiply by any other term, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, when multiplying the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is what we want for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nThe constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, I need to consider the entire expression. But wait, I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Let me think.\n\nActually, no. The expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out) in the second part. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, actually, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall expression, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each will contribute to different terms in the product. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that would be if we were looking for a specific term, but in this case, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, for each such term, we can have different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) for each \\(k = 2\\). Wait, no, that would give us the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is not correct because each term in the product will have different \\(c\\) exponents. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not right either. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is not just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asked for a coefficient, it's a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so we can treat the second expansion as a separate part and just multiply the coefficients. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but the problem is written as a product of two separate expressions, so when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively distributing the second expansion across the first. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two separate binomials, perhaps the coefficient is simply the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which contributes to the coefficient. But if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), those would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I only need to consider the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nSo, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first expansion) times 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, giving 384, but that seems incorrect because the sum of coefficients includes all terms, but we only want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term. So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this. If I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). For each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is whatever. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms? That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left( \\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-4} \\right)\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would have different exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables together, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered, and any power of \\(c\\) is acceptable. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the other expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that seems confusing. Maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's part of a product, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the problem might be asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, treating all variables as separate, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6, and the other part is a separate factor. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, each term will have \\(c^{m - (6 - m)} = c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier, with a coefficient of 6. Now, when this term is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right because each term from the second expansion has its own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the other factors. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it.

But that seems too broad because the coefficient is usually a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) from the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, with coefficient 6. When multiplied by each term from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term from the second expansion has its own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the rest is a separate factor. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other factors. But that seems too simple, and I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check online or in my notes to see if there's a standard approach for this. Hmm, I recall that when you have a product of two bin"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The specific term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Here, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, that's interesting. So, in the product, when I multiply the terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when multiplied by the second factor, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make much sense because the second expression is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), which includes positive and negative powers. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense, because otherwise, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be an infinite sum, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That is, we need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, to find this, we can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and we're looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is in the second polynomial, their product will give us the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients. \n\nSo, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. \n\nWait, but actually, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other part. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so maybe there's more to it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, which we don't want. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I'll expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\).

So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) comes from multiplying the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term would introduce other variables.

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), that gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on, the second part of the expression is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. \n\nWait, let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAh, I see now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, no, because any other term from the second expansion would have a positive or negative exponent on \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. Then, for the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, that's correct. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the expansion will have terms for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). Specifically, the terms are:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. That means I can't just look at \\((a + b)^4\\) alone; I also have to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think. The question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and it's multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just the coefficient times \\(1^n\\), so the sum is the sum of all coefficients. \n\nSo, let me calculate \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. \n\nIs it correct to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part? Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as a polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, if the first part contributes 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when all its coefficients are summed, is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, if the question was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, for each such term, we can have different powers of \\(c\\) depending on \\(m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum over all possible \\(m\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the appropriate \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. \n\nLet me just verify this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 2^4 \\times 2^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). \n\nBut if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 1, and the entire product is 1024. However, this doesn't directly help me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Instead, maybe I can use the concept of generating functions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as two separate generating functions. The generating function for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the generating function for \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second part, you're effectively scaling the entire first part by each coefficient in the second part. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part, we multiply these results:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a \\(c\\) component. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually zero because there's no way to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that seems confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and they just want the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, I might need to find all the terms in the expansion where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients, considering the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually would imply that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is only concerned with the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I'm not sure. Hmm, I need to clarify this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two independent expansions.

So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to different terms in the product.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would each form a different term in the product. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be different.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable and consider that when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, meaning it's just 1. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nWait, that sounds correct. So, let me proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as I did before, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6 \\times 6) = 720/36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as calculated using the binomial coefficients. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, let me think about it another way. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression and \\(c^0\\) is a term in the second expression, their product is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expansion as a product and see if there's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, but that's not the case because each term in the second expansion contributes a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is to take the term where the second expansion is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nWait, I think I've convinced myself that 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nChecking binomial coefficients again:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct.\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct.\n- 6 * 20 = 120, correct.\n\nYes, that all adds up. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term):\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
