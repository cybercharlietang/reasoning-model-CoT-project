    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, that's:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a second, so I have another part here: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well.\n\nI think what's happening is that the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the variables are different, when I multiply them, the terms from each expansion will combine. However, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the other expansion.\n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just going to be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the other expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will actually be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expansion will just add a coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that might not be correct either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a single term, but in reality, the product will have terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. Wait, no, that can't be right because in the product, each term is a combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but in reality, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all k of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) times 6. But actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which means you have to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6. But wait, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's being multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Wait, that's a different approach. So, maybe I was wrong before. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's different. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're to sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. Alternatively, it might be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which is the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\n\\]\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Let me take another example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2 c + a^2 / c + 2ab c + 2ab / c + b^2 c + b^2 / c\n\\]\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's being multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all these coefficients. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the general case. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part of the product, right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), unless it affects the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, actually, no. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients in the product won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So I think I can focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and then maybe the other part just contributes a constant factor, which I can compute separately and then multiply by the coefficient I found. Let me check that.\n\nSo first, let's tackle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), I can expand this. In this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). So the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, what about the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does this mean that the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a constant multiplier for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), including a constant term. So maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That way, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by that constant term. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term (where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) will contribute to the term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So that's why I only needed the constant term from the second part, and then multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or something else, but I think the approach I took is solid. So I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

That means when I multiply the two expansions together, I need to find the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

The first part gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the second part gives the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) as 20. Since these are independent parts of the product, their coefficients multiply together when considering the product of the two expansions.

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).

I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), that means the coefficient from the second part is just 1, right? Because when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum of terms, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is just multiplied by each term in the second part. However, each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from both parts.\n\nWait, but if the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), its expansion will have terms like \\(\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression with \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the second part has multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be considering only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both expansions, but since the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which includes all variables.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me check this again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with coefficients 6 multiplied by the respective coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). However, in the product, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a separate term with different exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's asking for the coefficient when you treat \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both parts. Since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is part of the term with \\(c\\). But that seems contradictory because the coefficient should account for the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all such products, which is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would have multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each with a coefficient of 6 multiplied by the respective coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because I might be misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall term. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should account for all the terms in the product.\n\nWait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms in the first polynomial that can combine to form that term. In this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6=64\\), the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is just multiplied by the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which includes the contributions from both parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. Therefore, the total coefficient is the sum over all terms in the second part of (coefficient from first part * coefficient from second part).\n\nBut since the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part's coefficients sum up to 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm confusing the concept here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's asking for the coefficient when you treat \\(c\\) as another variable. In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), with coefficients being 6 times the respective coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my interpretation. Let me go back. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I should focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first because that's where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from. Once I find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in that expansion, maybe I don't even need to worry about the other part because it's multiplied by something else. Or do I? Hmm, maybe I need to consider both parts because the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), I can write:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\times 1 \\times b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. Let me do that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\n= \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\) as \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and we've already found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. But when we multiply by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait a second, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering the entire expression, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either because each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me check that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then since it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems to imply that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a polynomial, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (the coefficient from the first expansion) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is a product of two binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nBut let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part because it's multiplied by terms that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense either because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients like 6c^6, 6*6c^4, 6*15c^2, 6*20, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and ignoring the second part because it's multiplied by something else. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients. But now, considering only the constant term, it's 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by expanding both parts and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I only need to focus on the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another part of the expression, maybe their coefficients won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me see.\n\nSo, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but since the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to compute all the terms. Wait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is a product of these two expansions, so when I multiply them, the terms from each expansion will multiply together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that any term from the second expansion will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the coefficient? Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply by terms involving \\(c\\), they will create terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself won't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that would be a term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), right? Similarly, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\) would be \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I think I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only that term will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent: \\(6 - m - m = 6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. That seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the terms combine. Each term in the first polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). When I multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, and the second term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). For the product to have no \\(c\\) terms, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yep, that's the same as before.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part of the product, right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by some combination of terms from the second expansion. But wait, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or does it? Let me check the problem again.\n\nAh, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can consider each part separately. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe that's the only contribution. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) expanded as \\( ... + \\text{coefficient} \\cdot a^2b^2 + ... \\) and then multiplied by \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\) which is \\( ... + \\text{some terms} + ... \\), then the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other part. So, for example, if you have \\( (P(a,b))(Q(c)) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nSo, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the other terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm correct in considering that the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me try expanding both parts step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is as I found, with coefficient 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that's not possible because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then it's a single term.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I need to consider all possible terms where the power of \\(c\\) is anything, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all coefficients from the second expansion. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each possible power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, so I should look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that's different from my previous answer. So which one is correct? Let me think carefully.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's the former, considering all \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and each term would have a specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any reference to \\(c\\). So perhaps they're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, for example, if you have \\(P(a,b) \\cdot Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nSo, in this case, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or whether it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nBut let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nThe way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the product includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times each of those coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone wouldn't make sense unless we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nLet me think about this again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any reference to \\(c\\), then perhaps it's considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but then why didn't the problem specify \\(c^0\\)? Maybe it's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the"

Once I have that, maybe I can just multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part since they're multiplied together. Or perhaps I need to consider both expansions together? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, no, because the variables are different. The first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\).

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means I need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we can consider that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). To do this, I can consider the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, which we already found has a coefficient of 6. Now, from the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(c^0\\). That means I need the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me find the term with \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n\n6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, the second part's coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^{2}b^{2}\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients together if needed.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So in this case, \\(n = 4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to worry about this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So actually, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's expansion will contribute terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients from the second part would just multiply the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, actually, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then perhaps I don't need to consider the expansion of the second part at all, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Hmm, that might be the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion (which involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion (which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So that term in the product would be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So each of those terms would have some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. Hmm, but let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that approach. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check by expanding: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a (1/c)\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient is 2. That works. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which also works. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 4. So the coefficient would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let me check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The product would have terms like \\(a^2 c^2\\), \\(a^2 * 2\\), \\(a^2 * 1/c^2\\), etc. So the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, which is correct. So yes, the approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. So the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6, which is 64*6=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me try to expand both parts and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So the coefficients for each power of \\(c\\) are the binomial coefficients.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So each of those products will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So that's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes when you have negative exponents, the coefficients might not all add up the same way, but in this case, when \\(c = 1\\), it's fine because \\(1^{-1} = 1\\). So yes, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Hmm, but since the variables are separate, I think the approach I took is correct. So I think 384 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a coefficient, effectively scaling it by those coefficients.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a coefficient that's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in the problem statement, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that would be incorrect because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But if I do that, I get 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that's not right because the second expansion isn't a single term but a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to sum all the contributions from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not the case because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't seem correct because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just 6 times 64 because that would imply that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, each term is separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), should be considered. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't a numerical value. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first expansion, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify that; it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nLet me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because it would be a polynomial.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so perhaps the variables are separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since it's not specified, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire second expansion evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't set \\(c"

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to expand the entire expression. Maybe I can just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, if I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this will have terms \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it because when I multiply the two expansions together, only the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part that contribute to this term. That is, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part. So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, which is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, I think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part for this particular term. Let me think. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from the product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nIs that right? Let me make sure. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, it will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^3\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^1\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-1}\\), etc. So when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. \n\nBut if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, it will introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I can tackle each part separately. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion with coefficient 20. When I multiply these two terms together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nIs there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms, but that seems more complicated. I think breaking it down into the two separate parts and then multiplying the coefficients is the correct approach. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so unless the problem is asking for a specific coefficient involving \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, I would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, let me proceed with that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) power. But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting 120, assuming that we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, but if we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) is also at a certain power, then it's 6 times the coefficient of that power in the second expansion. Since the problem didn't specify, but it's common to look for the constant term, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without specifying \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but given that it's a math problem, it's likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so unless the problem is asking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), the coefficient isn't a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the context where \\(c\\) is a variable, and they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients do multiply.\n\nWait, let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not just 1, but \\(c + 1/c\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, unless the problem specifies a particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the coefficient as 6, but that seems incorrect based on the example I just did.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's a misstatement, and the problem is just \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. So, given that, I think the intended answer is 120. Therefore, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlright, let me break it down. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the overall expression is a product of two expansions. Since multiplication distributes over addition, the entire expression will be the product of each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I can think of this as: when I multiply the two expansions together, which terms from each expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Well, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, maybe I don't even need to consider the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That might mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's only referring to the coefficient in the first part, and the second part might affect it differently. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the other variables. So, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we just want the coefficient when the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared. So, in other words, we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar multiple when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), that's a different term than \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the case where the second expansion contributes a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, so they wouldn't contribute to the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, now I need to compute two things: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and second, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I'll multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term comes from the other polynomial, their product gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6-m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6-2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\nMultiplying these two coefficients together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I think I need to focus on the part of the expansion that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\), and then see how it interacts with the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nLet me break it down. The entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is involved, the terms from each expansion will multiply together. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) separately and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be the right approach because the variables involved are different. \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts independently.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second. But wait, no, that would give me all the terms, but I only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion, including the \\(c\\) terms, but looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems a bit odd because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because if you have multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), you would have to sum their coefficients. But maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term from the other expansion, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we consider the entire expression, each term would be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) comes from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then it's a specific term in the expansion. So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would involve two parts: first, finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiplying those two coefficients together.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^{2}\\), which is \\(6 a^2 b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). Simplifying the exponent, that's \\(c^{m - (6 - m)} = c^{2m - 6}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But we're interested in the term where the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which would have the coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, right? So, since we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, each term in the product would have specific exponents for each variable, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), not multiple ones. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then it's a specific term in the expansion.\n\nIf that's the case, then my earlier calculation is correct: 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The product would have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value from that expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(m\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would actually involve all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion of the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a numerical value.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, then multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which the problem isn't asking for. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions and multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and it will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). Setting \\(2m - 6 = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. But in this case, since the problem is about two separate variables, I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120, considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^k b^{4-k}\n   \\]\n   The term where \\(k = 2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^m \\left(\\dfrac{"

Let me think.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will combine. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and then consider how it interacts with the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms from the second expansion won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the second part. But that seems too easy. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, every term in the first is multiplied by every term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part has negative exponents, so it's not just a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which also includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with c)}\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and sum their coefficients. But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\)s, \\(b\\)s, and \\(c\\)s. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that would mean the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient infinite or something, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a specific term, say with coefficient \\(C\\), and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., each of those would contribute to different terms in the final product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be \\(C\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a polynomial with positive coefficients; it has both positive and negative exponents.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expansion. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that must be it. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is straightforward using the binomial theorem. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nOkay, let's start with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients we found: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only take the term from the second part where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

That means I might not need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, actually, since the entire expression is a product of two binomials, when I multiply them out, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply the constant term in the second part, right? Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it will introduce variables that aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term, I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the term to be constant, the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by another term? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so only the constant term from the second expansion would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term would include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Or do I?\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions, so when I multiply them out, the terms will involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second part. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and some term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion evaluated at the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but does such a term exist?\n\nLet me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 20, right?\n\nOkay, so first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, as I thought earlier, this term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, and that's 20.\n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will have a factor involving \\(c\\). However, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion? But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Wait, no, I think I was right the first time. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term of the second polynomial, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but if I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial. So, maybe the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But that's not standard. Usually, when asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in the entire expression, considering all variables. So, perhaps the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and wants the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 64, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion arises from what exactly the problem is asking. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, then it's looking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression when considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) alone, ignoring \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120.\n\nSo, which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Since \\(c\\) is another variable, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that logic. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\)) * (sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? Let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let's compute that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if we're only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. But according to this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384 because it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\". Since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, my initial thought of 120 was incorrect because I was only considering the constant term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply these results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to focus on the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and maybe the part involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a constant factor or something. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that term.\n\nThe binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part just gets multiplied by the coefficient we found, and since it's not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just a constant multiplier.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well, just to see what it contributes. Using the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 as we found earlier, the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will just multiply this coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a^2b^2 * \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way for \\(c\\) to not be present is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when \\(m = 3\\). Let me compute that term.\n\nThe binomial coefficient when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the term is \\(20 c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which has coefficient 6) by this term (which is 20), we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, I get a product of two sums. Each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion.\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, as it's the only part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient will be 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. But since we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum over all possible terms in the second expansion that don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a constant when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only term in the second expansion that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, which is when \\(m = 3\\), as we found earlier, giving 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you expand the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), but only when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, I think that's correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6. And \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6a^2b^2, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes 20 when \\(m=3\\), so 6*20=120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term that does not involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient from the first expansion (6) by the constant term from the second expansion (20), we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe I should handle each part separately and then multiply them together. Let me see. \n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, does that mean I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, the resulting terms will involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, I think that implies we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would have some \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe the problem is that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion, but when multiplied by terms from the second part, the \\(c\\) terms would change, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually depend on the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\), because only those terms would not introduce any \\(c\\) into the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply it by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

That's correct too.\n\nMultiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion? Or perhaps not, because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, no, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's a product of two expressions. So, when you multiply them out, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right because the second expression isn't a single term. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms from both expansions. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficients are multiplied, not the terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a monomial with different powers of \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct because each term in the second expansion is a monomial with different exponents of \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But is that the correct interpretation?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because the second expansion isn't just a polynomial in \\(c\\); it's a Laurent polynomial with terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the resulting terms would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. But if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each, which matches the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, in this case, the approach seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. The expansion would have terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), etc., each multiplied by 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 4, which is correct. So, this approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I believe. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) term. So, does that mean it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\)? If that's the case, then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, as I thought earlier. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, as we saw, with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of each \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which gives us 6 * \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable doesn't depend on the other variable's terms. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second part is a separate expression, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part (64), resulting in \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I want. \n\nThe coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those will contribute to different parts of the expansion. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, thus leaving the term as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. \n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems right because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is a well-known combination, and I remember it's 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and realized that to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to multiply out the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, so their coefficients multiply. There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second expansion only contributes terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the term we're interested in. \n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is specifically from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor, or perhaps it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term at all. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the term from the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second part is multiplied by it. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the second part must contribute a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, let me start by finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions, we need to multiply the coefficients we found.

So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is separate.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only those terms won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term (from the second expansion), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), so we don't care about those.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). \n\nCalculating that, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), right?\n\nSo, in this case, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here. The expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to solve for \\(k\\) in the equation \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's separate. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. However, wait a second, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately because the variables are different. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient remains the same. Wait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the term from the second expansion is 1, right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1.\n\nSo, let me verify this. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is indeed \\(c^0\\), which we found to have a coefficient of 20. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this logic. Suppose I have two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, the terms are independent. So, any term in the first polynomial is multiplied by any term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^0\\), and then up to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since we're looking for the term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require that the term from the second polynomial is 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. 6 \u00d7 20 is 120, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand each part separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before.\n\nNow, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem, gives me:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), and so on. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only care about the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, that's the same result as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could there be any cross terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms and then another term that cancels out the \\(c\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial's terms involve only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term from the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is only the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step and verifying my reasoning, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does not involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I think I should focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because that's where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, so maybe their coefficients won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me confirm that thought.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. When you multiply them out, each term in the expansion of the first binomial will multiply each term in the expansion of the second binomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the part of the expansion that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first binomial and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second binomial because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the \\(c\\) terms in the second part will just contribute a coefficient, and their variables won't interfere with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute coefficients that multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the variables in the two parts are different. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^mc^{6 - m}\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, the only way for the term to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if \\(k = 2\\), and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's correct, and then the other part can be any term from the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the second part has a coefficient, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute a coefficient times that. But actually, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [some coefficient times \\(c^m\\)], but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you expand the product, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\). So, for each such term, the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the coefficient would then be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) over all \\(m\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). But let me check: \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by different variables. But no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds that coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding a bit. Let's consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's separate variables. But no, that's not correct because when you multiply, the coefficients do add up. So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of coefficients from the second part, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two binomials. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first binomial, its coefficient is 6, and the second binomial contributes a factor that is multiplied by this term. However, since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second binomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, so perhaps it's just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part has coefficients that would multiply the 6. Wait, no, because the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply these results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the question is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nLet me confirm that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is independent of \\(c\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So when I multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, the coefficient won't involve any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), it would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant term with respect to \\(c\\), it would be multiplied by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) depend on the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me approach this differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in \\((a + b)^4\\), it would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not all constants; they are coefficients of different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would only come from the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. All other terms would have extra \\(c\\) factors, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nYes, that seems right. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nAlright, let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. That is, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients together:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients found above:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come up is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by 1 from the second part.

But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that can't be right because the variables are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term is a product, so the variables have to combine. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, those terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so maybe that's the case.\n\nLet me think again.

So first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the sum of all its coefficients. Alternatively, since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that combine to form that term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. So the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So let me calculate that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So 6 times 64 is 384. But let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in terms that don't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the middle term where \\(c^0\\). Let me check that.\n\nWait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or something like that. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to have \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo let me calculate that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The key is that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\). Because if you take any other term from the second part, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, so why did I think it was 384 earlier? Because I thought the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients. But in reality, since we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\), the coefficient is 20, not 64. So the correct coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check this by considering the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Also, we need the term where \\(c\\) exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nSo I think I made a mistake earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be if we were looking for the constant term in the entire product, but in this case, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\).

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe I can handle the two parts separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will just be constants when multiplied with the first part. So, actually, I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms affecting the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Instead, the entire second part will just act as a scalar multiplier when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, does that mean I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, actually, I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut hold on, is that accurate? Because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by every coefficient in the second expansion, effectively summing them all.\n\nSo, to find the total coefficient, I need to calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which I found to be 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\), and the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSince we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, for the \\(c\\) terms, since they don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a polynomial with constant terms; it has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when we talk about the \"sum of all coefficients,\" do we really mean substituting \\(c = 1\\), which would give us the sum of the coefficients, treating \\(c\\) as 1? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) would collapse all the \\(c\\) terms into 1, effectively summing all the coefficients. So yes, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). But that's just the constant term. The sum of all coefficients would actually be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I did earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on, another thought. When I'm multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but only considering the terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, since all the terms in the second expansion are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other part of the expression, which is separate. So maybe I can handle these two parts separately and then multiply them together? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because \\(k = 2\\) in this case. Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what the coefficient is for each term in this expansion because when I multiply it with the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I have to consider all possible products. But wait, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiple.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but each of those will have different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a single term but a combination of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, and the variables are added. So, in this case, the first polynomial has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\), and so on. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times 6, which is 36, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of these would be a separate term. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present in the product unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a constant term (20) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me recap: I used the binomial theorem on both parts, found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, found the constant term in the second part, and multiplied them together. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is then given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
