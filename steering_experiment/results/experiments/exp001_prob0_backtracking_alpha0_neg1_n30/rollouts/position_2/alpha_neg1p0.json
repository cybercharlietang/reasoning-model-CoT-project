    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part of the product, right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems logical because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part only has \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, actually, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're adding more terms, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't get multiplied by anything else except constants from the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the entire product will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes a coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{something}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, is the coefficient 384? Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is the product of the coefficients. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the concept here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this again. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first part, the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) or \\(a^0b^2\\), but there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero. But if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then \\((a + b)^3\\) has a term \\(a^2b\\) and \\(ab^2\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be zero. Hmm, so in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just 6, but 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120, and so on. So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but they all have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the total coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, the total coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are multiplied together, when I expand everything, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only care about the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But wait, can that be right? Or do I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients shouldn't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat these two expansions independently.\n\nSo, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe the coefficient just remains the same? Or wait, no, that might not be correct because when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficients would multiply as well. Wait, but actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the other. So when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's denote the first expansion as \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and the second as \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Let's denote the first part as \\( P = (a + b)^4 \\) and the second part as \\( Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). So the entire expression is \\( P \\times Q \\). Now, when I expand \\( P \\times Q \\), each term in \\( P \\) will be multiplied by each term in \\( Q \\). So, for example, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) from \\( P \\) will be multiplied by each term in \\( Q \\), which includes terms like \\( c^6 \\), \\( 6c^4 \\), \\( 15c^2 \\), \\( 20 \\), \\( 15/c^2 \\), \\( 6/c^4 \\), \\( 1/c^6 \\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product \\( P \\times Q \\), we're actually looking for all terms where the \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) parts are \\( a^2b^2 \\), regardless of the power of \\( c \\). So, that means the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( P \\times Q \\) is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( P \\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( Q \\). Because each term in \\( Q \\) will multiply the \\( a^2b^2 \\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\( P = \\sum_{k} p_k \\) and \\( Q = \\sum_{m} q_m \\), then \\( P \\times Q = \\sum_{k,m} p_k q_m \\). So, the coefficient of a specific term in \\( P \\times Q \\) would be the product of the coefficients from \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\). But in this case, the specific term is \\( a^2b^2 \\times \\) something. Wait, no, because \\( Q \\) doesn't involve \\( a \\) or \\( b \\), so when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in \\( Q \\), you get terms like \\( a^2b^2c^6 \\), \\( 6a^2b^2c^4 \\), etc. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) regardless of the power of \\( c \\), that would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\( Q \\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( P \\). Because each term in \\( Q \\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the \\( a^2b^2 \\) term.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( P \\times Q \\), I can compute the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( P \\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\( Q \\). That makes sense because each term in \\( Q \\) will add to the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) when multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\).\n\nOkay, so let's compute the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( P = (a + b)^4 \\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\). So, the term where \\( a^2b^2 \\) occurs is when \\( 4 - k = 2 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\). So, the coefficient is \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\( Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, we can substitute \\( c = 1 \\). So, let's compute \\( Q \\) at \\( c = 1 \\): \\( \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64 \\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\( Q \\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product \\( P \\times Q \\) is \\( 6 \\times 64 = 384 \\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is indeed \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6 \\). Then, the sum of coefficients in \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\) is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, multiplying them gives 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum over all products of coefficients whose variables multiply to that term. But in this case, since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are only in \\( P \\), and \\( c \\) is only in \\( Q \\), the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\( P \\) times the sum of coefficients from \\( Q \\), because each term in \\( Q \\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\( a^2b^2 \\) term.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can treat the two parts separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term involving \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions, and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient will be the sum of all those products. Hmm, that complicates things because I thought maybe it's just 6, but actually, it's 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which would make \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too big. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient just gets multiplied by that coefficient, and the powers of \\(c\\) become separate terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) contribute to the coefficient? But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product will be products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will have the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [some term in \\(c\\)]. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me check this again because I might be making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second polynomial don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is not correct because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term in \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would involve multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), we have \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would have been 384, but now I'm considering that maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nHmm, the problem didn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's usually implied that you consider the coefficient regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all 2, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is in the denominator as well.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's looking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the products of the coefficients from each polynomial.\n\nBut in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be the case, but I was unsure. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. That makes sense because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial.\n\nSo, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. But since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, the product would have terms like 6a^2b^2c^k for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be the case, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1."

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they are separate variables. So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients?\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can expand this as well using the binomial theorem, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I just need to find the entire expansion of this part and then multiply it by the 6 from the first part? Wait, no, actually, the problem is a product of two expansions, so the overall expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with every term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means we need to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) such that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c^0\\). So, that is, the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nI already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. So, the first expansion gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second expansion gives 20 as the constant term, so when you multiply these, you get 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is given by:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me confirm that thought. The entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first binomial.

But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So I think that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, the terms will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^m \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). So each term in the expansion will be \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)}\\). Simplifying the exponent on \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{2m - 6}\\). But the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Now, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term from the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. \n\nWait, but is that accurate? Let me think. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So each term is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, I get terms like \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that means I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). Because each \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) is the coefficient from the second expansion, and when multiplied by \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{2m - 6}\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. \n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^{\\text{something}}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). \n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so 6 times 64 is 384. So the coefficient should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it just adds another factor. But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So yes, that makes sense. \n\nLet me double-check by expanding both parts. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^k b^{4 - k}\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\).

But wait, the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nFirst, let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). Therefore, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(a^4\\).\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the fifth term is \\(b^4\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). From this, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking about the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the other part as well?\n\nHmm, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. However, since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not about any specific power of \\(c\\), I might need to consider the entire expansion.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, then it's the coefficient when you multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the other expansion, but the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, perhaps the problem is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is just a multiplier that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), its coefficient in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that seems to suggest that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which is not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which is not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part in the expression.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the other part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be 6*(1 + 1)^6 = 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would require multiplying the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), so in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's expecting a numerical value, so 384 must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*64 = 384. That makes sense because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiplying by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, then it's multiplied by each term from the other expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the other expansion. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expression times the entire expansion of the second expression. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression, which is 6, and the second expression is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the other part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that suggests the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384. That seems plausible because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients, and then multiply by 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms together, which would mean the"

But hold on, the entire expression is the product of two binomials, so maybe the coefficients from both expansions multiply together. Hmm, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times 1, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so every term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients from the second expansion just multiply the coefficients from the first expansion, but since we're only looking for terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will be present in other terms, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part would contribute terms with \\(c\\) which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nActually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're only looking for the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will only have terms with \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is an integer from -6 to 6, in steps of 2, I think. So the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when the exponent is zero, which would be when \\(k=0\\). So in the second expansion, the term where \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, so that's the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so let's break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Finally, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial expansion is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need to find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So the constant term from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. When you multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final expression. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's correct.

The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).

The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe that part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Let me think.\n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\), expanding this using the binomial theorem would give me terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

Let me compute that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the second part contributes a coefficient of 20.

So, the first part gives me a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\), which is a constant. So when I multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

That term is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of both expressions. So perhaps I should first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part is multiplied by it, it's just the product of that coefficient and the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Okay, so that part is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in this expansion because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in this expansion, the coefficients from the second part will add up. Wait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion? I remember that the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part for each term is whatever it is, but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a separate variable from \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, if I were to expand both and multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, when I expand both parts, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the relevant coefficients. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, because the other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe when we multiply the two expansions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if we take any other term from the second expansion, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so that's correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs at \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's also correct.

Hmm, actually, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how the terms from both expansions multiply together. \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just contribute a coefficient, and then multiply by the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Let me think about that.\n\nFirst, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this as well using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're multiplying this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which includes terms like \\(a^2b^2\\), the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me check if I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will just contribute a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(64\\), as I calculated. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, that would be the coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nExpanding each part:\n\nFirst, as before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 64 from the second part, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of it another way. Suppose I expand both parts and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when multiplied, just adds coefficients. So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times 6. So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), because that's the binomial expansion of \\((1 + 1)^6\\). So, yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant term with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after going through this reasoning, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, it's just multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the product, it's equivalent to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen you multiply these, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if you're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, that happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), you have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

The exponent on \\(c\\) would be \\(m\\) from \\(c^m\\) and \\(-(6 - m)\\) from \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), so combining them gives \\(m - (6 - m) = 2m - 6\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I'm looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, in the second expansion, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term in the second expansion that contributes to the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo now, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that term's coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. But in this case, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). I know the binomial expansion formula is \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). I'm interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, which is when \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, this will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, I think that the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the variables are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those products. But that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which is not typical in such problems. So perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would require combining both expansions and looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to consider the product of the two expansions:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWhen I multiply these two together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), which happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So that's when \\(k = 2\\), which we already found has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, for the \\(c\\) terms, I want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So in the second expansion, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), but in the product, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So that would make sense, and that's what I calculated earlier: 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's the term without any \\(c\\) factors) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. So I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) parts are being ignored, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, so it's probably expecting an answer that takes into account the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a very large expression, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you have the product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each of these would be separate terms. Therefore, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient from the second part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term won't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part just gets multiplied as a whole.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Hmm, but actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is straightforward, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part, and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So let's break it down into two parts: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and second, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. So when we multiply these, we get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

So, perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will contribute a scaling factor to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, if I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would mean that when I multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, leaving me with a term that's just a constant, so that when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might make more sense because otherwise, if I consider all terms, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\) of the coefficients, which might not be necessary.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m (1/c)^n\\), which is \\(a^kb^l c^{m - n}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(l = 2\\) in the first expansion, and for any \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(m - n\\) is any integer, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can have any exponents. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but actually, that might not be correct because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be a large number. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me think. If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms would be the product of the two coefficients. So, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nI think I need to clarify the problem statement. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^lc^m\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) can be any integer from -6 to 6, depending on the expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But that seems complicated because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term in the first expansion, and in the second expansion, each term is a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied together, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second part is a Laurent polynomial (it includes negative exponents). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give the sum of coefficients as \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 64.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the expansion. So, if I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nI think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, so the total coefficient for that term across all products would be the coefficient in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 64.\n\nWait, but let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then I would need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply them together.\n\nLet me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's intended to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that the second part is multiplied by each term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a scaling factor to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that seems correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, so that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by computing it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nThis is obtained by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. So, perhaps I should check both interpretations.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384.\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^"

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to expand the entire expression. Maybe I can just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly interested in \\(c\\) terms, but I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part when multiplied together. Wait, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just get multiplied by 1, so I can treat this part as a constant when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Or maybe I need to check if there's any dependency, but I think since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at some term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a variable expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the variables in one part are independent of the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, multiplied by 6. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of a product with the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Is that correct? Wait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, since the variables are separate. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for any term would be the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying something. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems to work. Similarly, if I look for \\(a^1b^1\\), the coefficient in the first part is 2, and in the second part, the sum is 2, so total coefficient is 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct because each term in the second part gets multiplied by 2ab, giving 2ab*c + 2ab*(1/c), so 2ab times (c + 1/c), which when expanded gives 2ab*c + 2ab/c, so the coefficient for ab is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the second part doesn't just contribute a scalar multiple. Because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that \\(c\\) terms are being ignored, or that we're considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with coefficients that are polynomials in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the product more carefully. Let's denote the first part as \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and the second part as \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). The expansion of the first part is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\), and the expansion of the second part is \\( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nWhen you multiply these two expansions together, each term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, the general term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nNow, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the term will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) yields a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication distributes over addition, the entire expression can be expanded as the product of each term in the first expansion with each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can probably focus just on the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and then consider how the other expansion affects it. Wait, but the other expansion has \\(c\\) terms, which are different variables, so maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require that the term from the second expansion doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, it will have a \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the case.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the constant term in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply 6 by 20, you get 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, you get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just see if there's another way to approach it, maybe by considering the entire expansion. But I don't think that's necessary because I've broken it down into parts, and each part seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. So maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), or maybe just a part of it? Wait, no, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion multiply each other. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nFirst, let's focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be the case. Let me clarify: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms? Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the other expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from the other expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that the other part doesn't affect it, but that doesn't make sense because the two parts are multiplied together. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the other expansion, each term in the other expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6*64=384. But wait, let me think again: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one affects the coefficient of the same term in the product only when multiplied by 1 in the other expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if you have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), that's a different term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let's approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we can use the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be incorrect because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20. Then, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we determine the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem tells me that this expansion will be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by each coefficient there, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nBut wait, actually, when you have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the variable part is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient, and then adding them all together. So, that would give the total coefficient as 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second, which is 1 (from \\(c + 1/c\\)), so 1 * 1 = 1. But wait, in reality, the product would have \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is indeed 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, because each term in the product is \\(a^2 \\times c\\) and \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from c) + 1 (from 1/c) = 2. So, that's correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2 * 2 = 4, but wait, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 1 + 1 = 2, so 2 * 2 = 4. But in reality, the product would have terms like \\(2ab \\times c\\) and \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2c + 2/c, but when considering just the coefficients, without variables, it's 2 + 2 = 4. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributing a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would add up, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is there another way to approach this? Perhaps by considering the entire expansion and looking for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, their exponents are determined solely by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms just get multiplied along with each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a multiple of \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each multiple would contribute a separate term, but when considering the coefficient, you're effectively summing all the coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe an example would help. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then we have to consider the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which would be 1 (from \\(c\\)) and 1 (from \\(1/c\\)), so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) times \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2c + 2/c, but if we're just considering the numerical coefficient without variables, then it's 2 + 2 = 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4.\n\nExtending this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating this. Another approach is to realize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a variable part of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). When I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, each term in the second expansion will just scale \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by expanding it. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I did earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in some way? For example, if there were cross terms involving both \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), but in this case, the two polynomials are separate: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed determined solely by the coefficients from each part, as I calculated.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part of the product. So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part affecting this term? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is given by:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply it by the entire second expression, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), does that mean that any term involving \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus not be just \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the product would have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means, in the entire expansion, I need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and then sum their coefficients. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For there to be a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by this constant term 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply the entire first expansion by the entire second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, not just the constant term. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will be a term in the final expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would vary depending on \\(k\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would imply that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would be the same as in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then it's a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that doesn't seem to be the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from terms in the expansion that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from, say, -6 to +6 in steps of 2, depending on the expansion.\n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so it's \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. Alternatively, it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, and that's probably what is intended. So, let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, first, as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, as I calculated. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6\\dbinom{6}{m}. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and \\(c\\) is another variable that doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the terms would be products of terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*(1 + 1)^6 = 6*64 = 384. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nWait, that approach must be wrong. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), but that's when \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. The problem is likely asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, as I thought earlier. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product would have terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6\\dbinom{6}{m}. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 6*\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6*20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6*64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably asking for a specific term, not the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*(1 + 1)^6 = 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, maybe it's intended to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all terms in the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384. But let me check with a simpler example to see if that makes sense.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me break this down. Since the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, I think I need to expand each part separately and then multiply them together, but maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that when you have a product of two expansions, the coefficients multiply for the terms that combine. So perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then see how it interacts with the second part. \n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I know the binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any other variables. That means I don't need to worry about how \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate expansions, one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, say \\( (X)(Y) \\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(X\\) times the entire \\(Y\\) would give you the contribution to that term in the product. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that can't be right because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, the answer is 384. \n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where \\(c^0\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which occurs when we have equal numbers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). For this to be \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm confused because sometimes problems like this assume that you're looking for the term where all variables are present, but in this case, \\(c\\) is a separate variable. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, each multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a coefficient. But in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, no, in the expansion, each term is a product of the terms from each binomial. So, in the example, the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part when multiplied by the second part. Wait, no, in the first part, \\(b^2\\) is a term, so when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\). Similarly, the \\(a^2\\) term becomes \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), and the \\(2ab\\) term becomes \\(2ab(c + 1/c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the two parts don't interfere. But that can't be right because in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in the product, but its coefficient is multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of \\((a + b)^2\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). So, in the original problem, since the two parts are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but in the original problem, it's non-zero. Wait, in the example, \\((a + b)^2\\) only has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), so there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when multiplied by the second part, there's still no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is zero. But in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second part, that term exists in the product, but its coefficient is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding both parts. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, their sum is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches \\(2^6\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would have calculated it differently. In that case, we would find the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiply by 6, giving 120. But since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems to be part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem tells us that this is equal to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, I need to consider how it interacts with the second part. But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the coefficient without considering any \\(c\\) terms, I think I can treat the two expansions separately.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of each term in the product are the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the original polynomials. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the second factor contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me break this down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = 20 \\times c^0 = 20\\). So when you multiply these two, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake there. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

That will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nLet me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\).

So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\) as well. Therefore, the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let's think. Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) vary from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2. When we substitute \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\), so the sum is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second. So, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering the entire expression as a product and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Similarly, the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems to only involve the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are in the second part, so maybe they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I should first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then consider how the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects it. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a product, not a sum. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes to multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression adds a multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, for example, if the second expression had terms like \\(c^3\\), \\(c^2\\), etc., each of those would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, for example, if the second expression had a term like 5c^2, then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by 5, resulting in 5a^2b^2c^2. Similarly, another term like 3/c would give 3a^2b^2/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, A = (a + b)^4 and B = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, A * B = (a + b)^4 * (c + 1/c)^6. Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in A * B, it's the same as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in A times the sum of all coefficients in B, because each term in B is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by a^2b^2, it just adds a multiple to the a^2b^2 term. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in A * B is (coefficient of a^2b^2 in A) multiplied by (sum of coefficients in B).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of (a + b)^4 is the sum from k=0 to 4 of C(4, k) a^{4 - k} b^k. So, the term where a^2b^2 is when 4 - k = 2, so k = 2. So, the coefficient is C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting c = 1. So, if we set c = 1, then (1 + 1/1)^6 = (2)^6 = 64. So, the sum of coefficients in B is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product A * B is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you expand (c + 1/c)^6, each term is of the form C(6, k) c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = C(6, k) c^{6 - 2k}. So, the coefficients are C(6, k) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is indeed when c = 1, so (1 + 1)^6 = 64.\n\nSo, putting it together, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since a^2b^2 doesn't involve c, the only way to get a^2b^2 in the product is to take the a^2b^2 term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, but wait, the second part doesn't have a constant term unless we consider c^0. Let me see.\n\nWait, in (c + 1/c)^6, the general term is C(6, k) c^{6 - k} * (1/c)^k = C(6, k) c^{6 - 2k}. So, the term where the exponent of c is zero is when 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3. So, the constant term is C(6, 3) = 20. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 times the constant term in (c + 1/c)^6, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought the sum of coefficients is 64, but now I'm getting 20. So which is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product. So, in the product, a^2b^2 can only come from a^2b^2 in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part, because any other term in the second part would introduce a power of c, making it a^2b^2c^k or a^2b^2/c^k, which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 multiplied by the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6.\n\nSo, in (c + 1/c)^6, the constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, which occurs when 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3. So, the coefficient is C(6, 3) = 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients is 64, but that would be if I'm considering the entire expansion. But in reality, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is only affected by the constant term in the second expression because any other term would change the variables. So, I think I was wrong earlier when I thought it's 6 * 64. It's actually 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this. Let's take a simple example. Suppose we have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion of (a + b)^2 is a^2 + 2ab + b^2. The expansion of (c + 1/c) is c + 1/c. Now, the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because in the product, the a^2 term is multiplied by c and 1/c, giving a^2c and a^2/c, but there's no a^2b^2 term. Wait, that's different. So in this case, the coefficient is zero. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient of a^2 in (a + b)^2 is 1, and the constant term in (c + 1/c)^1 is zero because there's no constant term. So, 1 * 0 = 0, which matches.\n\nBut in the original problem, the constant term is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought that the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 multiplied by any power of c, but since we're only looking for a^2b^2, regardless of c's power, that's not the case. So, actually, the correct approach is to take the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part. Because only the constant term in the second part doesn't introduce any c terms, so when multiplied by a^2b^2, it remains a^2b^2. All other terms in the second part would result in a^2b^2 multiplied by some power of c, which would not be the same as a^2b^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example to be sure. Suppose we have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. There is no a^2b^2 term, so the coefficient is zero. According to my corrected approach, the coefficient of a^1b^0 in (a + b)^1 is 1, and the constant term in (c + 1/c)^1 is zero, so 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: (a + b)^3 * (c + 1/c)^2. Let's compute the coefficient of a^2b^2. Wait, in (a + b)^3, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because the expansion only goes up to a^3 and b^3, and the term a^2b^2 would require n=4, but here n=3. So, the coefficient is zero, which is correct because you can't have a^2b^2 in (a + b)^3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, (a + b)^4, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6, and in (c + 1/c)^6, the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, which was wrong because I was considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, and 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 times any power of c, but since we're only looking for a^2b^2, regardless of c's exponent, we have to consider only the constant term in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(C(4, 2) = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(C(6, 3) = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems to be part of the first binomial expansion, right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, so maybe their expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, first, let me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). In this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has a power of \\(c\\) depending on \\(m\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only in the first part, right? Because the second part only has \\(c\\) terms. So when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the question is just about \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by that term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each in different variables. So, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. Therefore, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which can't be a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient is just a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would imply that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nSo, let me proceed under that assumption. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second polynomial. So, their product is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider all possible terms in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients of each \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) term, where \\(k\\) can be any integer. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)).\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which is it? Let me think carefully.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, every term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and each of those coefficients is multiplied by 6, resulting in the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of each variable's exponent. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product with \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which introduces \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a number that includes all the contributions from the \\(c\\) terms. But let me think about it in another way. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P would be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, which one is it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient, and the total coefficient would be the sum of all those scalings.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\"

    "text": " The same goes for the other part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So maybe I can first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and then deal with the other part separately.\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem. It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the third term in this expansion. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nWait, actually, when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe any term multiplied by it from the second expression will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of the product. \n\nBut wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nBut hold on, I'm being asked only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So maybe the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of the other part. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific term, but \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and they want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in a product of polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to consider the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the other expansion with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, correct. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(k=3\\) gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct as well. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, so only the term where \\(k=3\\) in the second expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there are other ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because the first part is only contributing \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is contributing \\(c^0\\), so there's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c^0\\) term. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) will give \\(20a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\) attached, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So when you multiply these two, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my previous step, I thought of it as \\(a^2b^2\\) times 20, but actually, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so it's 6 * 20, not 6 * 20 * a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider all the terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) with the constant term \\(20\\) from the second expansion. So, the term would be \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, after carefully thinking through each step and verifying my calculations, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I know the binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, let's find the coefficient for that term.\n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

I need to think about how this interacts with the first part. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part?

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficient in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, maybe we can treat the second part as a constant? Hmm, that doesn't sound quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) from the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 for the constant term. Since these are multiplied together, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that might not be correct because the entire expression is a product, so maybe I need to consider how the terms interact. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two separate variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their expansions don't interfere with each other. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems unusual because typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in terms of other variables, but here, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be the case. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up.\n\nBut let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product are of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), depending on the term from the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficients are separate. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). So the term where \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), they become the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So to find that, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but all have the same \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But that would require considering the product of the two expansions and looking for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two separate binomial expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're considering all possible terms, we sum them up.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems to make sense.\n\nWait, but let me check with an alternative approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as we found earlier, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients in the product are the products of the coefficients from each part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the second part, you're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient adds up.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that sometimes when dealing with negative exponents, the coefficients can cancel out or something. But in this case, since we're just summing the coefficients, regardless of the exponents, it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then find the sum of its coefficients. Let's try that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the coefficients multiply.\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20c^0, I get 120a^2b^2. But wait, that's just one term. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which means I have to consider all terms where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because only then will the term be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second"

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, let me think. The entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So when I multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so perhaps I need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Hmm, but that seems complicated. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would just carry along the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's the sum of all its coefficients. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, then the product will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^k b^{4 - k}\\) from the first part and \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^m \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\) from the second part, which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so the overall term would be \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^k b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is consistent because \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for the first part, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Now, for the second part, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we're just looking for the coefficient when \\(m\\) is such that \\(c^{2m - 6}\\) is 1, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (i.e., 1) would be the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nWait, but that would mean the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply the two expressions, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from the first part and the specific term from the second part where \\(c^0\\) occurs, which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) part is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expansion. Wait, no, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a combination of an \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) term. But \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible \\(c\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that would be 6 * (sum of binomial coefficients for the second expansion). Wait, but the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, that might be the case. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all those coefficients.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct because in reality, the product would have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each with their own \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of one affect the coefficients of the other. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, but if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 1) times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 2 (since (c + 1/c) has coefficients 1 and 1, summing to 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, so it's not just the product of the coefficients, but rather, the sum of the products of coefficients from each expansion where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and then multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents add up to zero for \\(c\\). So, from the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, and from the second part, we need the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) = 20. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that's ambiguous. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignores the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the product includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the same as if we were to collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the entire second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which can't be the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. The term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't a single number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the term is \\(c^0\\).
