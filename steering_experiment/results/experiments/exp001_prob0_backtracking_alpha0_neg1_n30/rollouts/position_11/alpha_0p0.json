    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean that any term from the second expression will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the way the question is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, maybe the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's another expansion. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the expansion would have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expression, which is 6*(something). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Let me try another way. Maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. Wait, but let me check my calculations again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The first expansion gives me terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, that sum is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, considering the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider that as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the other parts? Or do I need to consider how the two expansions interact? Wait, no, because the two parts are multiplied together. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, the coefficient from the second expansion will just be multiplied by 1, or maybe it's a constant? Wait, no, actually, the second expansion is a separate part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that would mean the term doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But that can't be, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, it's a different term. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But unless we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which would just be a constant term, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of that. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, that makes sense. So, first, we found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6\u00d76) is 720/36 = 20. So, the coefficient is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we found. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when we multiply by \\(c^0\\), which has coefficient 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, while \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the variables don't interfere with each other. That is, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient remains 6. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part would contribute a factor that's just 1 because it's being multiplied by 1 (since we're not considering any specific term in \\(c\\)). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-express the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But the problem is written as a product, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That would involve multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.

Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be separate terms. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but considering all possible terms, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, and then summed up. But that would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering the sum of all coefficients, which seems incorrect because the problem specifically asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything else. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient will be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check this logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). When I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, for \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, for \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to all terms where \\(k=2\\) and \\(m=2\\), regardless of \\(n\\). But in reality, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's what I thought earlier, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But when I listed out the terms, I saw that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to multiple terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then it would be 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem statement is a bit unclear. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in polynomial terms, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically include all the coefficients from the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as part of the term, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), making it a different term each time. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Wait, but earlier when I multiplied 6 * 20, I got 120, which corresponds to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of all coefficients being 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of multiple variables, usually refers to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's not a single term but a combination of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiple. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial, not a scalar. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire polynomial, which would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way to interpret it is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right"

    "text": " Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it? Hmm, let me think. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that contributes, and the entire second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a multiplier. Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Because when you multiply, you're actually multiplying each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of both expressions. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply both expressions, you might get terms where \\(c\\) has some exponent, and they want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that the coefficient is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that might make sense. So, perhaps I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that approach. \n\nSo, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be the coefficient. \n\nWait, but is that the correct approach? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me write out the product more carefully. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire product is considered, but only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's expecting a numerical value, so the correct approach is to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving a coefficient of 120. \n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and for the second part, we need the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. As I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, and just multiplied the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by 6, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire polynomial, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, the only way the coefficient is a number is if we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier, and then the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be... but wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the entire term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a coefficient, that's an expression. So, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making the term a constant. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the constant term. Because when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which would be a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, and just thought that the coefficient is 6, that would be incorrect because the entire expression includes the second part, which contributes a factor. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But wait, actually, no, it's being multiplied by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) separately from the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. Because when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, but I think that's not the case. Let me think again. When I have two polynomials multiplied together, say P(a, b) * Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) remains the same when multiplied by Q(c), because Q(c) doesn't involve a or b. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. The first expansion involves a and b, and the second involves c and 1/c. Since the variables are different, the only way for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating c as a variable, but perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Hmm, that might make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean considering the product of the terms from each expansion where the exponents add up to zero for c. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of c to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from the first expansion) times 20 (from the second expansion) equals 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, the second part's constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the term. Wait, that might be it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would imply that we're looking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, no, actually, that's not how it works. Because when you multiply by the second expression, you're adding terms involving \\(c\\), but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a term that still has \\(c\\) in it. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, it would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes a term 20 (the constant term), so 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miss anything. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire product. The entire product would have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). So, as we found earlier, that term is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a single expression and look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, that term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is indeed the coefficient.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check my steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), it's 6, which is correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), it's 20, which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does the second part affect that? Or is it just the first part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply them together, each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in the second expansion? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^k\\), it will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get that, we need to find all terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me work on that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. Let me compute that term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and that's 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I guess I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate. Or do I? Wait, no. The entire expression is multiplied together, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in another. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will multiply with the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the \\(c\\) part as a constant coefficient. Let me think. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor that is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion. So, maybe I should first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply that by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts multiply to \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the \\(c\\) parts can be anything, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps we can sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, and when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion also has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But I think that's not exactly correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a two-variable expression. Wait, no, actually, the expression is in three variables: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make it a function of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check my reasoning again.\n\nWait, so the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so I can treat the second part as a single term and just multiply the coefficients. But no, that doesn't seem right because the second part is an expansion with multiple terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But wait, that's not exactly correct because the second expansion isn't just a single term. It's an entire polynomial. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial reasoning was correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're only concerned with \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions. Wait, but that's essentially the same as multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the total contribution is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me just confirm that I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), correct. Then, 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts and multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions, which again is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the sum of all coefficients in this expansion.

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the second part because they are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't interact. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, but the product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), giving 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are involved, the coefficients can be more nuanced. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's effectively 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expressions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the entire other expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the product and see, but that might be time-consuming. Let me try a different approach. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply them. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But that's not quite right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's effectively the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different from \\(c\\), the variables in each term won't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second part, each term is just a scalar coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, it's like 6 times each of those coefficients, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, but when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it's like the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like a lot.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When we multiply this by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, and when you multiply by \\(c^4\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, etc. So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the expansion that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem isn't specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384?\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But that feels high, and I might be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another approach: When you have two independent expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is present in all those terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, and the rest is part of the other variables. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is (c + 1/c), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's the sum of coefficients, which would be 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, because the coefficient from the second part is 2. Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2.\n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense with the simpler example. So, I think that's the right approach.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the expression would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of this. Wait, but if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute 6 * 1^2 * 1^2 = 6, and the entire expression would evaluate to 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. But that doesn't directly help me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as two separate expansions: the first in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second part is a separate polynomial. So, when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a constant with respect to the second part. So, when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire polynomial. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's like the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's not possible because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could have any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but that seems like it's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me check this again with the simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be \\(2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, if the problem were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, another way: Let me think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, it's actually the product of 6 and the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting more.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but"

Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then I have to multiply it by whatever comes from the second part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will contribute to the overall expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion will just get multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Or maybe it's just considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible terms from the second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check: the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, so it's the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem might just want the coefficient as a number, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), in which case it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. So, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions. But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when multiplying the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. \n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own variable, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a separate term, and similarly for other powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's not correct because each term would be a separate term. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not the case because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not accurate because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. The terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to compute two things: \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when multiplied together, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product because you're multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other terms would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think of it another way. If I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\)? Or does it mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by a term that's just a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in the second part. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, let me work on the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the term that's just a constant. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6 \u00d7 6 is 36, and 720 \u00f7 36 is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20. So, the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. Wait, hold on. Wait, no, actually, no. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by 1, as \\(c^0\\) is 1) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are just coefficients in front of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would contribute to the overall coefficient, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be considered as a separate factor, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from the second expansion will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But what's the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of all coefficients, I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), since it's independent of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as coefficients, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to make sure. Maybe I can expand both parts separately and then multiply them. So, first, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which is 6a^2b^2) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again to make sure I haven't missed anything. Is there a possibility that some terms in the second expansion could affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? For example, if I had a term involving \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would that change the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? No, because \\(c\\) is a different variable, so multiplying by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, all the terms in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in terms of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) or something similar. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but since the second expansion contributes a factor that is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's effectively a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of coefficients again. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms because they will contribute to different variables. Wait, but actually, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by constants, because any term involving \\(c\\) would change the variables, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will add to the variables, but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms, each of which is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Wait, that makes sense because if you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part that has \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Among all these terms, only the term \\(20a^2b^2\\) has just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the part that comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. But in my second thought, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 20, which contradicts the first conclusion. So, which one is correct? \n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and each term from the second part that doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the second part only involves \\(c\\), multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second part will just add a factor involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the second part is a separate term, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but when I thought of it as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*(2^6) = 6*64=384, which is way too big. So, that must be wrong. So, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of the constant term in the second part, which is 6*20=120. \n\nAlternatively, to confirm, let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we consider the product, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second part). The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384. But that's not right because when you set \\(c=1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, but in our case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, that approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of the constant term in the second part, which is 6*20=120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that's why it's 6*20=120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*20=120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6*6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term that remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient is 6*20=120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider any \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which includes both parts. So, maybe I need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something, it doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in each product, but the coefficient will be the sum of all the products of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), that term would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that \\(c\\) term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) part could have different exponents, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That seems plausible.\n\nSo, let me check that. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think my first approach is correct, where I'm looking for the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, that corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then from the second part, I need the term where \\(c\\) is raised to any power, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be anything. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be, because then the coefficient would depend on the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I was correct the first time, that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't fix the exponent of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times 20, giving 120. So, that must be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and perhaps \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, but the problem is only interested in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correctly written, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must have a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would still require the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times 20, giving 120. That seems to make sense because then the coefficient is a number. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, to summarize: In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when I multiply it by the entire second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the entire second expression is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms, but when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, then when I multiply by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be of the form \\((\\text{term from first expansion}) \\times (\\text{term from second expansion})\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is correctly interpreted as just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nAs before, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But when you multiply the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficients for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, we just multiply the coefficients. So, 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, gives 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\): that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nSince the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(Q(1) = 64\\), as calculated before, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to see this. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a single entity and just multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, perhaps they mean the coefficient as a numerical value, irrespective of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would still depend on \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables. But that's impossible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. That would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the second expansion, but that would still be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6, resulting in 384. \n\nWait, maybe I should just proceed with that answer. I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 is 384. Yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can compute the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems tedious, but maybe I can do it for verification. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I found earlier. \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b"

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that maybe the other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but actually, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^m \\times a^2b^2c^m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not right either. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms has a coefficient, and each of them will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, then yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire expression, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense because the expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's expand both parts separately and see how they interact. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is the coefficient from the second expansion, and when multiplied by 6, it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, and their coefficients don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient in the entire expression, we consider the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\).

Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively contributing to multiple terms in the final product. Wait, but no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we can treat the two parts as separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a sum of terms with different \\(c\\) powers. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to find the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because the second part can contribute any power of \\(c\\), but since we're not considering \\(c\\), we just take the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but how do we find the sum of all coefficients in the second part? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives us the sum of coefficients: \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about it differently. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check both possibilities. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all coefficients of \\(c\\), which gives the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then 384 is the answer. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for some \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I can treat the two variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) as separate and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. To resolve this, perhaps I can think about how the terms interact. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if we substitute \\(c = 1\\), we get the sum of all coefficients, and that gives us 64 for the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're only looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check with an example. Let's take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first part, the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) or \\(a^0b^2\\), so when multiplied by the second part, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a different example. Maybe another example: \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The product is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be zero because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from different factors. Wait, no, in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the same factor, so the term \\(ab\\) would come from multiplying \\(a\\) by \\(b\\), but in this case, since it's \\((a + b)^1\\), the only terms are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the terms would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). There's no \\(ab\\) term here. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best example. Let me try with \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd need to multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, you only have \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\) unless you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first place, which you don't. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that product is zero.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, their exponents are independent. That means, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's separate. Let me check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as some terms involving \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are just coefficients in front of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would become \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms with c)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that doesn't seem right either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, those terms will be \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is to consider the product as a whole, and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might make sense. Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the answer is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the entire product. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me approach it differently. Let's think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me just confirm this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also (c + 1/c). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the entire product, it's (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, not a number. But in the original problem, the answer is expected to be a number, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would require me to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem on the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer would be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out? Hmm, in algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term with certain exponents is unique, so if you're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous because \\(c\\) can have any exponent. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. However, I'm a bit confused because in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is 384 because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the answer 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then 384 is the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which have different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. So, which is it? I think the problem is ambiguous, but since it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's more likely that the intended answer is 384, as that's the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, in many problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, they often imply considering the constant term with respect to the other variables. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Let me try to think of it another way. If I were to collect like terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's that entire expression, but if they want a numerical coefficient, they might be asking for the constant term, which is 6*20=120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the answer 384, considering all coefficients. But since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering the entire expansion, which would be 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps the second part is separate, and since it's multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*(something), but that"

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct. Then, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, correct. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. When expanding the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part evaluated at the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\).

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), otherwise, the product would have variables besides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, yes, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20.

Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another, when you multiply the two polynomials, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire product expanded, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, making its coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first factor, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, and its coefficient in the product would be the same as its coefficient in the first factor, multiplied by the entire second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is still a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire product expanded, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because the second factor is part of the product. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4"

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Hmm, maybe I need to think about whether the \\(c\\) terms affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, the second part can be anything because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if I'm looking for a specific term, I need to consider if the second part contributes anything to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term is 20. So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20, so when you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 6*20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply these, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the constant term in the second part (20) will result in a term that's just a multiple of a\u00b2b\u00b2. All other terms would have c's in them, which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the expression is multiplied by another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the second expression is a separate variable, so the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial. I must be misunderstanding something. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that. But the problem is only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expression. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but when we're talking about the coefficient in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me think about that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and from the second part, I need the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's implying that \\(c\\) can be any power, and the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, my initial thought was correct, and the answer is 120. Let me just confirm. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts together. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents in the product will be independent. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part doesn't interact with the terms from the second part in terms of the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term from the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will get multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficients from the second expansion will just add up as a scalar multiplier. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand that correctly. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms from the second expansion won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) in the second expansion because each term contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but is that the case? Let me test this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} \\times \\dbinom{1}{0} + \\dbinom{2}{0} \\times \\dbinom{1}{1}\\)? No, wait, that's not correct. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine by convolution. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1 (since \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)), and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 0 because \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 1 \u00d7 0 = 0. Alternatively, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then I would sum over all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. But in reality, when you multiply \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, as I thought. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 2. So, yes, that approach seems correct. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier to be 6. Now, I need to compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? Well, one way is to substitute \\(c = 1\\) because substituting 1 into the polynomial will sum all the coefficients. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64 because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that part seems correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, as we calculated using the binomial coefficient. So, multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. \n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Let's think about expanding the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). When we multiply these two polynomials together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = n\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) for each \\(k = 2\\). \n\nWait, but in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything, so we need to sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each contributing \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient. So, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so again, we get 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute this without using the substitution \\(c = 1\\), I could note that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is indeed 2^6, which is 64. So, that's consistent. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making any mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial gives the coefficient of that specific term in the product, regardless of the variables in the second polynomial. That seems correct because each term in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of the specific term in the first polynomial gets scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of that term in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see if the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}\\), etc., up to \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}\\). The sum of these coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the multinomial theorem or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions and consider how the coefficients multiply. \n\nWait, another approach: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomial expansions, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of any term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be the product of the corresponding coefficient in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so for a specific term in the first expansion, like \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient will be multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, and since we're summing over all possible terms in the second expansion, it's equivalent to multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, that again leads me to the same conclusion: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a different example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). As I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so the total coefficient would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. When I actually expand it, I get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2. So, this approach works. \n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any cross terms or dependencies between \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) that I haven't considered? I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their exponents don't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is solely determined by the first expansion multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial expansions.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial can be found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, after expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(6a^2b^2\\) as one of the terms. But then this term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, actually, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes more sense because the problem is asking for a specific term in the product, which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me confirm: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the coefficient would be the product of the two individual coefficients. \n\nAlright, so first, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this expansion. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = 1/c\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all the products where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give \\(c^0\\). Wait, but actually, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense, as it's a specific term in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two individual coefficients, 6 and 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined by \\(k\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for the \\(c\\) part, we need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with a different approach. Let's compute the product of the two expansions step by step. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the resulting terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) are:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, as previously found. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
