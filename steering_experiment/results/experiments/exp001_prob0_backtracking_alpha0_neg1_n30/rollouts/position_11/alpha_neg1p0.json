    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, let me think. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I can just find the coefficient in the first part and then, since the second part is being multiplied, I might need to consider the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, but no, because each term in the first part is being multiplied by each term in the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, if I consider \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the entire expression. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion). \n\nWait, but let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these has a coefficient, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) it's 6 * 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) it's 6 * 15, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all these coefficients? Because each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). But in reality, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) and 1 (from \\(a/c\\)), so total coefficient is 2, which matches 1 (from first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in second part). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, that seems to check out. \n\nTherefore, applying that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Maybe I can expand both parts separately and then see what the coefficient is. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) has a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me calculate that sum again to make sure. The coefficients in the second expansion are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this the correct approach? Because sometimes, when variables are separate, you don't multiply the coefficients like that. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) and 1 (from \\(a/c\\)), so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. Now, according to my previous method, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly for \\(b\\). So, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, no, because in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) times 6. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in: \n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2"

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that part is already determined from the first expansion, maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Or does it? Hmm, no, wait. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because every term in the second part will just add more factors involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for that term in the product will just be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of the second part is. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But if the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't care about the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and the second part is just another factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again: \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each of those terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I'm confused. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is simply 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is irrelevant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a key point. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 15c^4 + 60c^2 + 160 + 60c^{-2} + 15c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer they're looking for. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because when you multiply by the second expression, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all terms from both expansions. But no, the problem specifically mentions the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then you would have to consider the product of the two expansions.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for because it's not clear whether to consider the entire expansion or just the part with \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the part involving \\(c\\) is multiplied by each term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120 when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is from a textbook or somewhere else. Sometimes, problems like this ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe it's to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely answer is 120, because it's more specific. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) where \\(m\\) can be any integer from -6 to 6, depending on the expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But this seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That makes sense because it's a specific term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct answer is 120 because it's the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at the zero power. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely because the problem would probably specify if it wanted the sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually structured. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials, it's referring to the specific term, considering all variables. So, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which gives me the total coefficient for \\(a^2"

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Oh, wait, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the other part involves \\(c\\). So, perhaps when we multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if the exponent is zero, then \\(c^0 = 1\\), so the term would just be a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait a second, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe the second part can be considered separately, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it? Let me think.

When you have two separate expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one expansion will be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + \\dots\\), where A is the \\(a^4\\) term, B is the \\(a^3b\\) term, and so on, up to the \\(b^4\\) term. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded into terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, I think it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expansion, you'll have \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the variables. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only when multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) would the resulting term be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we can just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of the product. So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, so when you multiply it by each term in the other expansion, each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually require that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, that makes more sense. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has coefficient 6, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the other expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the concepts here. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of that term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that seems off because the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But let me verify this with a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., constant terms, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would mean the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in algebraic expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually referring to the term that matches exactly in the variables you're considering. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is considered without regard to the others. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so every term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute it both ways.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, then the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nBut given the problem statement, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, when you multiply them, each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) would be multiplied by every term in Q(c), which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b). Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified that it wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to see which interpretation is correct. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) * (c + 1/c). So, the product would be a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. Now, if I look for the coefficient of a^2b^2, but in this case, there are no b^2 terms multiplied by a^2, except in the first part. Wait, actually, in this example, the term a^2b^2 would come from a^2 * b^2, but in the product, each term from (a + b)^2 is multiplied by each term from (c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would actually be zero because in the product, you have terms like a^2c, a^2/c, 2ab c, etc., but not a^2b^2. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, in (a + b)^2, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because (a + b)^2 only goes up to a^2 and b^2 separately. Wait, no, actually, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So, the term 2ab is the only term with both a and b. So, when you multiply by (c + 1/c), the term 2ab would become 2ab c + 2ab /c. So, there is no a^2b^2 term in the product. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero. Hmm, but in this case, the coefficient is zero because the product doesn't have a term with both a^2 and b^2. Wait, but in the original problem, the first part is (a + b)^4, which does have a term a^2b^2. So, in that case, when you multiply by (c + 1/c)^6, the term a^2b^2 would be multiplied by each term in (c + 1/c)^6, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my simpler example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because (a + b)^2 doesn't have a term with"

I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, when I expand the product, each term will be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that. But since the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first part.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. So, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, no, that's not quite right either because each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the entire second expression.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms. But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, but that would still leave it in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not involving \\(c\\). So, let me proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the same as the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6*20=120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), the combined coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear is if we multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expansion, like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it's a different variable. That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply by the entire second expression, each term in the first expression is scaled by the entire second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients for specific terms in one polynomial don't just get multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the other. Instead, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the variables are different, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, if the second expansion has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have a coefficient of 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients for the second part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the second part contributes a factor of 64 when considering the entire product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But when considering just the coefficient, we need to consider the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, because the variables are different, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check by expanding both parts. Let me try expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) a bit more. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, which means that when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I should consider if the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them:\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\nLooking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term with \\(b^2\\) in the second polynomial. Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So, in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are separate. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my simpler example, when I did \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because there's no \\(b\\) term in the second polynomial. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, my logic must be flawed.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second polynomial. Because in the product, the variables are separate, so to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply it by a term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I think I misinterpreted the problem earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it not a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in reality, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's correct that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, how do we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, my initial mistake was thinking that the entire sum of coefficients in the second polynomial was needed, but actually, we need only the constant term because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), allowing the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to stand alone. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check this conclusion. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nTo further confirm, let me consider the entire expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, only the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making them not pure \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think I corrected my initial mistake, and the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the other terms as coefficients. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That would mean that in the expansion of the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 from the first part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first part and \\(c^m (1/c)^n\\) from the second part, where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a term involving \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a number. So, perhaps I need to consider that.\n\nSo, to clarify, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. So, to find this, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be the product of the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), which have coefficients 6 and 20, respectively. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expansion as a product of two independent expansions. So, any term in the product would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k * \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} * \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms it.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as we found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which again, doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the binomial coefficients from each expansion. Specifically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider both expansions and how they interact? Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Okay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So, when I multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion as the product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yeah, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, as I did before, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) from the second polynomial. So, that's why we multiply the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for a term that involved both \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we would have to consider more terms, but since it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the constant term from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, after double-checking, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of these two parts, but the variables involved in the second part are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the expansion of the second part because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider how the two expansions interact. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the product of any term from the first expansion with any term from the second expansion will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part? Because when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, first, let me find the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part? Let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by each term in P(a, b). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents k, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms is the sum of the coefficients from Q(c). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's only about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but I think in the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you consider the entire expression, including all variables. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different exponents k. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion.

Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when multiplied by 1? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that when multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be the constant term, right? Because if it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then the resulting term will still have \\(a^2b^2\\), but with some coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

I need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6 \u00d7 6 is 36, and 720 \u00f7 36 is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficients will multiply as well. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the term should be independent of \\(c\\), meaning \\(k = 0\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables also combine. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part would have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I might be misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider the product of the two expressions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are different variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so that it's a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That might make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can again use the binomial theorem. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, yes, I think 120 is the correct answer. Alternatively, if I consider that when multiplying two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we only consider the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that makes sense. So, I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part and then multiplying them.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I think that term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any other terms involving \\(c\\), maybe we can consider the entire expansion as a product. However, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the other part. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the terms will combine, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a different power of \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be something like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different exponents, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become separate terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that exists in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which could be \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by. So, in the product, every term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc., but the coefficient for each of these terms will be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without specifying any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But wait, actually, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would give the coefficient as 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and any exponent for \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be that entire polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so the term where \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's just 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Because when you multiply by something, if the term doesn't involve that variable, it's like multiplying by 1. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because only then will \\(c^0 = 1\\) and the term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me check that logic. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will have a power of \\(c\\) and a power of \\(1/c\\). So, if I take the term with \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that term is just a constant, and when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for the product of specific terms from each. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term from the second expansion contributes, so it's just 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems solid. I used the binomial theorem correctly for both expansions, identified the correct terms, and multiplied the coefficients together. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable and considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you're essentially taking each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that would result in an expression involving \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, the coefficient is scaled by the entire second expression. Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's an expression, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But is that correct? Let me think. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that the correct approach? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, if you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then that would be different. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product by considering that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the expression involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement, which asks for the coefficient in the entire product. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting me to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the term in the second expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent is zero. Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if this is what it's asking for. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat the entire expression as a single polynomial and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the correct approach is to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\), so the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm still a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps it's expecting me to compute the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting me to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct approach is to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the entire first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression multiplies each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., the constant term), we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^{0}\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

Does that mean I also need to consider the expansion of the second part? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe it's considering the entire product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all the terms in the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. But that seems complicated. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), we include its coefficient. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that approach. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that's a different answer. Now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? I think it's the former, because if it's the latter, the problem would probably specify something like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the constant term or something similar. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Wait, maybe I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). That suggests that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think about it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you only need the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all terms from the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in the second polynomial for \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 120, which is when considering only the constant term. Let me see which interpretation is correct. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct answer. Alternatively, let me compute the entire expansion to confirm. Wait, that might take too long, but perhaps I can check for a smaller exponent. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiplying these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 2 + 1) = 8, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 2 + 1) = 4. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) are each multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 4. Therefore, this supports the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is 6 times 64, which is 384.

Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all its terms multiplied by 6, the sum of its coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, do I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well? Hmm, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, but 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't seem right because the second expression isn't a single term. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms in the final product. So, in other words, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever is from the second part? Wait, no, because the second part is being multiplied by the first part. So, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the terms from each will combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to consider the part of the expression that comes from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part.

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 in the second part. Wait, no, actually, the second part is a separate expression, so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and the second part is being multiplied as a whole, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only involve the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms would be separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the rest of the expression is just multiplied along. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one gets multiplied by each term in the other. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part can contribute terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute is the constant term from the second part, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would only be multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, let me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just verify that again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.

So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Let me check that. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the variables in each part are independent. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the coefficient times some expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any further conditions on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for a coefficient, they want a numerical coefficient, not another polynomial. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by 6, it's like distributing the 6 across all the terms in the second polynomial. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the first part is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when you multiply them, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. So, let me check that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the answer would be 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), with each term's coefficient being 6 times the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for a coefficient without specifying other variables, they want a numerical value. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignore the second part. But that seems too simple, so I think the intended approach is to consider the constant term in the second part. So, to confirm, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120.

Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, right? So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c \\times c^{-1} = c^0 = 1\\). So, that term would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. When we multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms; we just want the part that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do we need to consider specific terms from the second expansion? Wait, no, I think I might be confusing things. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, since the second part is multiplied by this term, the overall term will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because each term in the expansion will have different powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a sum over all possible \\(m\\), because for each \\(m\\), you have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\)? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, so we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the two expressions are multiplied together. So, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we need a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's not a single number but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that we're to consider all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's not correct because in this case, the expansion would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is 0. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(2\\), so 2 times 2 is 4, but that's not correct because the actual coefficient is 0. So, my earlier logic is flawed. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. So, perhaps the correct approach is different. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for a term to be \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not given. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the two variables are independent. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But earlier, when I tested with a simpler case, this approach gave the wrong answer, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. In the simpler case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0 because there's no such term. But according to my earlier logic, it would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(2\\), so 2 times 2 is 4, which is incorrect. So, my approach is flawed. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in reasoning. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because that's when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. But why? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if you consider all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384, but that's not correct because in reality, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, but in the simpler case, that approach failed. Wait, in the simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, but according to that logic, it would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so 4, which is wrong. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. Let me check that. In the simpler case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 0, because there is no constant term. Wait, no, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times 0, which is 0, which matches the actual expansion. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, the coefficient"

Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients multiply term by term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and in the second expression, each term is a power of \\(c\\), which doesn't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expression. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you have two independent expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\). So, when you multiply 6 by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second part is multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't directly a term in the product unless the second part has a constant term, which it doesn't because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, there is no constant term in the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would not exist in the product because it would have to be multiplied by 1 (the constant term) from the second part, which isn't there. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so it's expecting a numerical answer, probably non-zero. So, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me go back. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient gets multiplied by the coefficients from the second expression. So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second expression has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients become the coefficients for terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in the second expression. Because if the second expression had a constant term, say \\(c^0\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant term would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). But if the second expression doesn't have a constant term, then \\(a^2b^2\\) wouldn't appear in the product. So, does \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) have a constant term?\n\nLet me think. When you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the exponent to be zero (i.e., a constant term), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, yes, there is a constant term when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought the sum of the coefficients was 64, but that's only if we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of the coefficients, but in reality, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term in the second expression. So, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me verify this. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expression to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional factors of \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait a second, but I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the part of the expansion where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, let me find the value of \\(m\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that contributes to the term without \\(c\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any possibility I missed something? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I'm only concerned with the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each. The other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since the problem doesn't involve \\(c\\), those terms would contribute to other parts of the expansion, not to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I'm correct in only considering the constant term in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions, and when I multiply them, the terms multiply term by term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only consider the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) factor, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems sound. The key was recognizing that only the constant term in the second expansion would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, as any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yeah, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me re-read the problem to make sure. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them out, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's considering the entire coefficient, including all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be a sum over all possible terms, which doesn't make much sense because the second part is a series in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient itself is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). I'm a bit confused here. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\). But that seems unusual because typically, coefficients are constants, not expressions in other variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. Let me proceed under that assumption because otherwise, the problem doesn't quite make sense. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). To do that, I can consider the product of the two expansions. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is needed. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure. So, the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(20c^0\\). When you multiply these together, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical value but an expression. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think my initial assumption is correct, and the answer is 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term \\(c^0\\) (constant term) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The combined coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need to consider how this part affects the overall coefficient. Wait, but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider specific terms from the second part?\n\nWait, hold on. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that can't be right because the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will be separate terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would actually be zero because the second part has \\(c\\) terms, so when you multiply, you can't have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) unless the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part. That makes sense because \\(c^0\\) would mean that term doesn't affect the \\(c\\) part, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).
