    "text": " I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe they are independent variables. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we write out the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we need to collect all those. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate variable. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply P and Q, we get \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P will be multiplied by every term in Q, but since Q involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product multiplied by each term in Q. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as in P, because when you multiply by Q, you're just adding more terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in P, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of Q, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two separate binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in Q will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q. But the sum of the coefficients in Q is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of the coefficients in Q, since each term in Q contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in P, because Q doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from P times the entire expansion of Q, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from P times the sum of the coefficients in Q. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from P times the sum of the coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I think of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in P, because Q doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, but since Q has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from P will be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in Q. Wait, that's a different approach. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that would correspond to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q. Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P will be multiplied by each term in Q, and only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, as we calculated earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand Q: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The key is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or specifically the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). If it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 * sum of coefficients in Q, which is 6 * 64 = 384. If it's the latter, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all coefficients from Q multiplied by the coefficient from P, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q). The sum of coefficients in Q is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term in Q. So, which interpretation is correct? Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by each term in Q, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from Q multiplied by the coefficient from P. Because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q, you're creating terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the sum over all \\(c\\) exponents. So, the answer should be 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would make it 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). So, each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so I'm a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire product as a single expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part contributes 6, and the second part contributes 64 (the sum of its coefficients), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c \\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 1 * 2 = 2. So, in that small example, it works out. Therefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm confused. Let me double-check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only when multiplied by the constant term in Q, which is 20, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, depending on how the problem is interpreted, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If it's asking for"

    "text": " I'm not sure how this part interacts with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Or do I? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify anything about the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or perhaps it's considering all possible coefficients, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That seems more likely. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's tackle the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the term with \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). It just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible coefficients regardless of \\(c\\). But that wouldn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when you multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in that expansion, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a single term; it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, or if it's considering the entire coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded expression, which would involve summing over all possible coefficients from the other part. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten and only wants the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But I think the more accurate approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the coefficients from both parts. So, to clarify, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because why include it then? Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384, but that doesn't seem right either because the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, I get a sum of terms where each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) times some coefficient. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), specifically \\(c^m\\) where \\(m\\) can be from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a single term in the product; it's part of multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just 6, but that seems too simple, especially since the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering \\(c^0\\), the answer is 120. Alternatively, if it's just asking for the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, but that seems less likely given the presence of the other part. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but since the problem is asking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the constant term in the second part is 20, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. When we multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if the variables are the same. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the constant term in the second expression is just a number, 20, then yes, the coefficients should multiply. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part gave me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part gave me 20 as the constant term, so multiplying them together gives 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   Thus, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, I need to make sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20, so when I multiply those together, I get 120. That makes sense because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second part. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the correct answer. Wait, did I miss anything? Let me see. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term in the second expansion affects it. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just a constant multiplier when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I can find the value of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that might just be a constant that I can multiply by 6 to get the final coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), maybe I can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when looking at the coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, involving \\(c\\), would just be a multiplier. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a constant. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you might have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from those terms. So, maybe I need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{another thing}\\), then when I multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we need to sum all those contributions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find that? Wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all \\(k\\), which is equivalent to evaluating the second part at \\(c = 1\\), giving the sum of coefficients as 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, when I considered \\(c^0\\), I got 120. So, which is it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm a bit confused because in the initial approach, I thought of the coefficient as 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to multiply it by each term in the second polynomial and sum them up. But since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify any power, so perhaps it's considering all possible powers, which would make the coefficient a sum over all coefficients from the second polynomial. Wait, but that's not how it works. Each term in the product is a combination of terms from both polynomials. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean I'm summing over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial, which is equivalent to evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), as I did before. So, that would give 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. However, I'm a bit unsure because the problem includes \\(c\\) terms, which are separate variables. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different case. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^0\\), which is just \\((a + b)^2 \\times 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only has up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's take a simpler case where the answer is clear. Suppose the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^0\\), which is just \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, the coefficient is 6, as before. If it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 6*(1 + 1) = 12. Wait, but in reality, \\((c + 1/c)\\) has coefficients 1 and 1 for \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the sum is 2, so 6*2=12. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 12, considering all terms involving \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6*0=0 because there's no constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\). Wait, no, \\((c + 1/c)\\) does have a constant term? No, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be zero. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The way I interpret this is that we're looking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the sum of all coefficients of terms of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then we would have needed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's the former: 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, the answer would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense that it's considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\),"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit more complicated. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part of the expression. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Let me think about that. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in any term will only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will only come from the second part. Therefore, when looking for a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply, you have to consider that each term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means that the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake by thinking that the entire expansion's coefficients sum is 64. Let me think differently. Perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, 1 from the second expansion, that's 6a^2b^2. But if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^6\\), that's \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and so on for each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion contributes a different coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) depending on the coefficient of that term. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is only 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. So, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we are only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, the rest of the variables (involving \\(c\\)) don't matter. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion and see, but that would be too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by 64 (the sum of its coefficients), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do I need to consider something else? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, since every term in the second part will be multiplied by the 6. But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because the second part is raised to the 6th power, but since it's being multiplied, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expression? But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to treat it as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product of two expressions. So, to get the coefficient, I need to consider the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might be expected to consider the term in the context of all variables, but here, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and coefficients are typically numerical, perhaps the problem expects us to treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar multiple, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expression. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not another expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to recognize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent with standard polynomial multiplication. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because any term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Let me verify this approach. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all its terms will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that approach seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand both expressions and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I would have to consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the term, perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, we consider the sum of its coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Because if we take any non-constant term from the second part, it would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, but we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the first part is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20, then the overall coefficient would be the product of these two, because when you multiply the terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and it would be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, so yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because any other terms from the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, and then I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first will be multiplied by every term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that the entire expansion of the second part contributes a factor to the coefficient. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients in the second expansion and multiply by 6. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term of the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion would have powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but not to \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Therefore, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but rather 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me do that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, so now I'm getting two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (\\(20\\)), giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, my initial thought that it was 384 was incorrect because I mistakenly multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part isn't a single number; it's a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each such term would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve summing over all possible \\(k\\), because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by the second expression, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the expansion of the second part isn't a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part, which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That seems more plausible. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as calculated earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write out the expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under a different interpretation. Now, under this interpretation, it's 120. I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120 is the right answer. Let me double-check. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient will be 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, I'm not sure if I need to expand that part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect that term? Let me think. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomials multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps we need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then see how it interacts with \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that term as a standalone term and the rest will involve \\(c\\) terms, which we don't care about. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, so let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, including the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two separate coefficients because the variables are independent. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe their expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Or does it? Let me think. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part would contribute other terms involving \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) terms.

So, that term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would include terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, implying it's a constant or something. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expansion of the product, we'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, each of these terms would have a coefficient that's 6 multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we might have to sum all those coefficients. Wait, but that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a term in the product, which would include terms with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), right? Because each term in the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would include all the terms with \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high. Wait, let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \\times 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 \\times 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms, each multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \\times 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply with the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's calculate that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 \\times 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I had considered all the terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if we're only looking for the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That way, the final term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient of }c^0\\text{ in the second part)}\\). So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of both parts. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - We seek the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I wonder if I need to consider that part as well, or if the problem is only focusing on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a factor that is multiplied by 6, but doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied as a scalar factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term would have some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just the scalar coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that might not make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\) when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I need to find the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That seems plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, and that term comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the constant term 20, it becomes 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

    "text": " Hmm, I need to see if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and not the entire term, we can treat the second part as a constant multiplier. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think again. No, actually, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables in the two parts are separate, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of each term in the second expansion is some number, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we can consider that the entire second expansion is a constant multiplier for the first part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a number, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm correct. Let me see another way: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be 6 times each of the coefficients in the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Hmm, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with multiple variables, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me consider the problem again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined solely by the part \\((a + b)^4\\), and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) just multiplies each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider if the second expansion could affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, it doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined only by the first expansion, and the coefficients are multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at it differently. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what its sum of coefficients is. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's right. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to, say, \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in this expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the second expansion, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the sum is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That checks out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all the terms from both parts. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6. But wait, let me check that again. Let me think of it as two separate expansions: the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, as in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), but that something would include all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\text{(sum of coefficients in the second expansion)}\\). Wait, that makes sense. Because if you have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6. Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(6c^4\\) would give \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 36. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything else. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated to be 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, that part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the other terms involving \\(c\\). Let me think. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms from that expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me break this down. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the term we're interested in. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficients from each part, we multiply 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part. Since these are independent, their coefficients multiply, so yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple. Let me check again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (terms involving \\(c\\)), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem statement is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean that it's considering only the part with \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a product of two separate expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion.

So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check again. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term, so when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, since the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first expansion, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. So, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, that would require considering both expansions together.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c^0 = 1\\).\n\nSo, to find this, we can consider the expansion of each part and then find the product terms where the exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) should be 0. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nSo, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, but that was when I considered the entire sum of coefficients, which isn't correct. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which requires considering both expansions and their respective coefficients where the exponents add up to the desired term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me expand both parts separately and then see if the product term gives me the correct coefficient.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand it:\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about 64, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is when \\(c = 1\\), giving 64. But that approach was incorrect because we need to find the specific term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nSo, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we expand the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion isn't being summed; it's being multiplied term by term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that's why we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had been just \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient would be 6. But since it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all these products. But that's not possible because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nHmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that suggests that perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (without any \\(c\\) term) is only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but in reality, when you multiply, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is paired with every term in \\(c\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

    "text": " I wonder if that part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6? Hmm, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), then when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the overall coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I need to find the coefficient where, in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because \\(c + 1/c\\) raised to the 6th power will have terms with exponents ranging from 6 down to -6, in steps of 2. So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is the middle term. Let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's different from 384. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but if it's part of the entire product, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each contributing their own \\(c\\) term. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is also squared to 0, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because in the product, each term is a combination of exponents from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems to contradict the earlier thought where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all terms in the other part, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own \\(c\\) term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when problems ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they might be considering the term where all variables are specified, but in this case, the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), not mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient 6. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120, which is 6 * 20. So, where did I go wrong? Let me clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without any restrictions on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. But wait, in the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are \\(a, b, c\\). So, when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is whatever. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, they might be referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I think 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case it would be 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). So, the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms like term from P multiplied by term from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b), say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by all terms in Q(c), will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * sum of coefficients in Q(c). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is when c=1, so (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. The coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, 6*64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it might be 120, but that was when I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, I think I was confused earlier, but now I'm confident that the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire product. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of"

    "text": " I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms come from the second part. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That means I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when I multiply the two expansions together, every term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms from the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. However, the second expansion does involve \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so unless the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, that term would be the only one that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To find that, I can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) which is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term of the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about it as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20, and adding any other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second polynomial doesn't have any terms that affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), those are the only contributions. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " I'm wondering if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with each term in the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might only need to consider the part of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, because any other term would introduce factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever term in the second expansion gives me 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. Let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, as I found earlier, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), as I found, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). So, the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that other terms from the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^1\\) and another with \\(c^{-1}\\), but when multiplied by some other terms, could they somehow combine to give a constant term? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Any other terms from the second expansion would introduce a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Hmm, I wonder if that part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first part, and the second part, when expanded, will contribute a factor that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will contribute a constant factor to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no. Because when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. So, if I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b) = \\sum p_i a^i b^j\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\sum q_k c^k\\), then when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(p_{2,2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, first, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is obtained by plugging in \\(c = 1\\) into the polynomial. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, but only if the variables are the same. However, in this case, the variables are different. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each contributing a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms will have coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Let me confirm this approach with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my method, it would have been 1 * 2 = 2. That means my approach is flawed. So, where did I go wrong? Let me think again. In the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the product doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first part only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require a term where both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are present, but in the first part, \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms become \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2/c\\). None of these terms have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed zero. But according to my earlier method, I would have said it's 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, my initial approach was wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this. Maybe I should consider that the variables are independent, so when multiplying the two expressions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes directly from the first part, and the second part contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But in reality, the second part involves \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but in the earlier example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6, but that seems too simplistic. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\), which contradicts the problem's wording because it's asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave an incorrect result. So, maybe the problem is designed such that the variables are separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, independent of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients combine. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Let me explore that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, in my earlier example, if I apply this method, let's see: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is the term where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(\\dbinom{1}{k} c^{1 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{1}{k} c^{1 - 2k}\\). Setting exponent to 0: \\(1 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 0.5\\), which is not an integer, so there is no constant term. Therefore, the constant term is 0. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0, which matches the actual expansion. So, this method works. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that approach didn't work in the example. So, perhaps the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 0 because the first part is only linear in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient should be 0. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 1. The constant term in the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^3\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{3}{k} c^{3 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{3}{k} c^{3 - 2k}\\). Setting exponent to 0: \\(3 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 1.5\\), which is not an integer, so the constant term is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2\\) does have \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 0. So, in this case, the method works. Therefore, returning to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, in the initial expansion, the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. The problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 38"

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), then the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could be any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), then that term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I find that, I can multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero because we need the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the expression also includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that would mean 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can compute the entire expansion and see. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which is 6a^2b^2) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but the coefficients from the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and when we sum them up for all \\(m\\), that's the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me verify this because I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the coefficient to include the \\(c\\) terms, but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's the coefficient multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if there's another way. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's just 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that are polynomials in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended answer is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first polynomial, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is also being multiplied. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) times Q(c) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to evaluate this coefficient as a polynomial, but the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient as a number, in which case, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64 + \\text{other terms}\\). So, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384, because the other terms from the second polynomial would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when considered as a polynomial, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to take the term from the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, right? Because if we take any term from the second expansion that has a \\(c\\) in it, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that makes sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the terms that don't interfere with each other's variables. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " I'm not sure if that part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but maybe I need to consider it. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second part.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part evaluated at whatever terms are present. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, that term would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat the second part as a separate polynomial and just consider the product. Wait, no, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is found by evaluating \\(P(1)\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms from both expansions. Wait, but no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which contradicts the problem's wording. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems odd because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient should account for the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That is, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. So, in that case, we would need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense because we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficients multiply. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering the \\(c^0\\) term, which would be 120. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is being multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Let me read the problem again: it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the second expansion will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is indeed 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) which is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to 64 terms, each with their own coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I should pick a different example where the first part has a term that could lead to \\(a^2b^2\\). Let's say \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product will have terms like \\(a^3c^2\\), \\(3a^2bc^2\\), etc. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^3\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe my initial approach is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to 64 terms, each with their own coefficients, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my smaller example, \\((a + b)^3\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which makes sense. So, in the original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which matches the idea that the coefficient is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, but 1 * 2 = 2, which doesn't match the actual coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is zero. Wait, so maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no, in that example, the first expansion doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, regardless of the second expansion. So, maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. But in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, so the total coefficient is zero, which is correct. In the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, for example, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), you would have to find all combinations where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) add up to 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But in this problem, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, that would mean that for each term in the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\), it is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, in this case, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which would require \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of another way. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product is \\(A \\times B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get 6a^2b^2 times each term in the expansion, which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a"

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I just need to multiply the coefficient I found in the first part by the constant term from the second part. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if the variables are not overlapping. So, in this case, since the first part is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), their coefficients will multiply, and the variables will multiply as well, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come up is if we take the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other expression. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me do that multiplication: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and correctly identified that I need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\). The binomial coefficient there is indeed 20. Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
