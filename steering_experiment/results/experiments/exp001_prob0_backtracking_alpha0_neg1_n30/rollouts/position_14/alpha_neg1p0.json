    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, their expansion won't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since we're only looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems a bit odd because the problem might just be asking for the numerical coefficient, not including the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, that seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the sense of the numerical factor, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(6 a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but I think the problem is more likely to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems like a possible approach. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me verify that again. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6 a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20 when \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, probably the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute a factor that's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Wait, but \\(c\\) is a variable, so how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms? But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I should look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the answer is indeed 6, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is multiplied by the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, its coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient an expression, not a number. So, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just extra. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely. Wait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, I think the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and not the terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{6}."

    "text": " I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\), I need to see if the product of the two parts affects the coefficient. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second part will just contribute a factor. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part.

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the product includes terms from both expansions.

So, does that mean that the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a constant multiplier for the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) part? Or do I need to consider it somehow? Hmm, maybe I need to think about how the two expressions are multiplied together. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\), which isn't present in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. If I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(A \\times B\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in \\(A\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expression \\(B\\).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) is just a scalar multiple. Let me think differently. Maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the value of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is a product, so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me approach this more carefully. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when multiplied by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar.

Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, so that's different from my earlier thought of 384. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, only the constant term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the constant term is 20, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found its constant term, which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I had considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, and multiplied by 6, I would get 384, but that would be the case if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second part, which isn't what the problem is asking. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so only the constant term in the second part contributes. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply everything together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part just contributes a constant factor? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if the term from the second part has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. When we multiply these together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, it just gets scaled by that constant. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Hmm, but the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, when I multiply these two, I need to consider all possible terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give a constant term, because if there's any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) left, it won't be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only. So, that suggests that I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only those terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term.

So, I think I need to find the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The binomial expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part.

That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

Hmm. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\), because when you set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of another variable. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever comes from the other part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm wrong, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is just multiplied by that, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I don't think that's correct because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the other part. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me try to write it out more clearly.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check what the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0 for the constant term, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. Let me double-check that reasoning. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, then perhaps it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. So, maybe the correct approach is to consider that when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Let me see which interpretation makes more sense. If we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the constant term, which is 20, giving 120. But I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 120. Let me confirm that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero. So, as I did earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), and setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient when considering all the terms in the entire product. Wait, no. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part that, when multiplied together, give the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's being multiplied by every term from the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each of those coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but their coefficients are just numbers. So, to find the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, I can set \\(c = 1\\), which would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients do add up. Wait, no, when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's phrased is just \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, when you multiply, each term will have specific powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do combine. Wait, maybe I should think about it as the product of two separate expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, no, hold on. I think I made a mistake. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but since it's a separate variable, the coefficient doesn't change. Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients do combine. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6. When I multiply by \\(B\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is \\(a^1b^0\\)) is c + 1/c, which has coefficients 1 and 1, so the coefficient is 2 when considering all terms. So, yes, that works. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply by 6. So, let's check that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent is 0. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The term where the exponent is 0 is when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, that's ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it could mean the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I need to clarify that. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But in the absence of any indication, I think it's more likely the former, 384. However, to be thorough, let me consider both possibilities.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'm a bit confused. But looking back at the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the former, 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me do a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2c\\) has coefficient 1, \\(a^2(1/c)\\) has coefficient 1, \\(2ab c\\) has coefficient 2, \\(2ab (1/c)\\) has coefficient 2, \\(b^2 c\\) has coefficient 1, and \\(b^2 (1/c)\\) has coefficient 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * 2 = 2. So, that approach works. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first. So, that supports the approach. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check one more time. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6"

    "text": " I notice that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, I will have terms from both expansions multiplied together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But that would make the coefficient dependent on the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would just be coefficients for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake by considering the sum of coefficients. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, the terms in the product will be combinations of terms from each expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just becomes a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times that \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term without considering \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes the second part. Wait, but no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion.

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must contribute a term that's a constant, i.e., 1, so that when multiplied by 6, it remains 6.

Or is it more nuanced? Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the terms combine. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that's not right. Let me think differently. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. But that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we look at the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach is correct. Suppose instead of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 6*(1 + 1) = 12. But if I actually multiply it out, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, multiplying by \\(c + 1/c\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6c + 6/c, which isn't a numerical coefficient. Therefore, my previous approach was wrong. So, I must be misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find that, we need to find all the ways that the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second polynomial can add up to zero when multiplied by the corresponding terms from the first polynomial. Wait, but the first polynomial doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the exponents of \\(c\\) only come from the second polynomial. Therefore, to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), we need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1.

So, maybe the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part can be considered as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the constant term is from the second part. Wait, but actually, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant when considering the product. So, the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20.

We want the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either because the coefficients in the second expansion are specific to each power of \\(c\\). Maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term would leave the \\(a^2b^2\\) term as is, without any \\(c\\) attached. So, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiply it by 6, and that will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check.

So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply the two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? No, that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, each term would be something like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any condition on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that's not what the problem states. The problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that also doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I need to interpret the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense either because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is some exponent from the second part. But the problem is only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(l = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two expressions, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expression, which involves \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, which would be the sum of coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire product is considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. So, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be right because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical value. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial, but only looking at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

Or do I need to consider how they might affect the coefficient? Hmm, I think since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, as calculated from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) just get multiplied by 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, you might have cross terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum up to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we're summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) would be the middle term. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused because I have two different answers depending on whether I consider the \\(c\\) terms or not. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but it's in the context of the entire expression which includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, giving 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try another way. Let's consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term, but in this case, the problem didn't specify. So, to be thorough, I'll check both interpretations. If we consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), then as I calculated before, the coefficient is 120. If we consider all terms, it's 384. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose we have an expression like \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem had specified that \\(c\\) must also be a certain power, like \\(c^0\\), then it would be 120, but since it's not specified, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because 1 comes from the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part, and (1 + 1) is the sum of coefficients in the second part. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, when I multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial gets multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that the case? Or do I need to consider the specific terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) combine in such a way that their exponents cancel out? Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would just be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would just be multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64.

Because when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to consider all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. But that can't be, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all the terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expression, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, perhaps I should interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, it doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, but that seems odd. Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), we get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when we expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get terms involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless \\(k=0\\). Wait, so maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me verify that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 6 = 2m => m = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, the only term without \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and realized that only the constant term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied, because any other term would introduce powers of \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). The constant term in the second expansion is 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient we're looking for. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider the entire coefficient as the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms} \\), then the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{each term in the second polynomial}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if we multiply by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, including the 20 term (which is \\(c^0\\)). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) would be \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, which is correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Hmm, seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, regardless of what the second part evaluates to, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times whatever the second part is. But that seems too simplistic because the second part isn't a constant; it's a variable expression. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will be a product of two separate expansions. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and then sum their coefficients. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple for each term in the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first factor, as the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first factor, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the second factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would include the second factor's contribution. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, the coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the product would have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that sum. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so when I multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have each term from the first expansion multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would require evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems reasonable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have each term from the first expansion multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, maybe it's expecting 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Let me check another way: if I expand both parts, the first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would result in multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one polynomial and \\(c\\) in the other, the coefficients don't multiply. Instead, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.

    "text": " But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the terms that don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the overall coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, perhaps each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we might have to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging in \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then the only term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term. So, perhaps I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which approach is correct? Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, then when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), and when you collect like terms, you'll have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I thought maybe only the constant term would contribute. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the way the variables interact. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term from the first part, so when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, when I think about it, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it would be 6 * 64. However, another interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But I'm a bit confused because in typical problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term without mentioning other variables, it's often assumed that you're considering the coefficient in the entire expression, regardless of other variables. Alternatively, sometimes it's considered that the term must be standalone, which would require the other variables to be at zero, but in this case, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. Wait, but let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2\\) is only multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, no, actually, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2(1/c)\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab (1/c)\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2(1/c)\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied together without involving \\(c\\). Wait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Hmm, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied together in the product unless you have a term that combines them without involving \\(c\\), which isn't possible here. Wait, no, that can't be right because in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would still be present, but multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2\\) is only multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) is only multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) to be multiplied together, which can't happen because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is either \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), or \\(b^2\\), and each of those is multiplied by terms in the second expansion, which involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be zero because you can't get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied together without also having a \\(c\\) term. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied together without involving \\(c\\). But that seems contradictory because in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), you do have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but when you multiply it by the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but not a standalone \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be zero because there's no term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is zero. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's correct. But for the term to be \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) must be zero, meaning \\(m - n = 0\\), so \\(m = n\\). Since \\(m + n = 6\\), then \\(m = n = 3\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3}(1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that would be the correct coefficient. Therefore, my initial confusion was between considering all coefficients in the second expansion and only the constant term. The correct approach is to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 in the first part and the constant term in the second part.\n\n1.

But since the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, their coefficients would multiply, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part would just contribute a constant factor, right?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are all separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together. But since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually numerical. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would still require considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to look up similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible combinations where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product give \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, so their exponents are determined by the first polynomial. The second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables together, but that seems impossible because \\(c\\) is separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms involving \\(c\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's simply 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 6, or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second part contributes a term that is 1, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless \\(k = 0\\), but actually, let's check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second expansion go from \\(6\\) to \\(-6\\) in steps of 2. So, the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being multiplied, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all terms from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must be that the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. Otherwise, if you have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), that's a different term, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be 6, right? Because when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by something, it doesn't change the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, it just adds more terms with \\(c\\) in them. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6, and the other terms would involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\). But the way the problem is phrased, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 6. Wait, but maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and see if there's any term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something else, but I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you expand the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that's not correct because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part of the product doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is 6. But wait, let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is only asking about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6. But maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, I have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give me terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, without considering the other terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as it stands, I think the answer is 6. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients aren't affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the coefficient is 6. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just another factor that's being multiplied, but it doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the answer is 6. Wait, but let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and then I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another expression, then the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). And since the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. So, which is correct? Let me think carefully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, you get 6 times each coefficient times a\u00b2b\u00b2 times the corresponding power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, you would sum all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be different. But as the problem is stated, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms specified. So, I think the correct answer is 384. Therefore, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms. But that would still require knowing which terms in the second expansion are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.

Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But again, that seems to be a polynomial, not a single number. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial. I'm stuck. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. So, let me try that approach. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer would be 120. Wait, that seems plausible. So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense as a single number. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 120.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second expansion is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's a single number, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense either because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so it would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, maybe not. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. So, let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) doesn't appear in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients. But the problem isn't asking for the sum; it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the intended answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps the intended answer is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignore the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, which is 6, and the rest is just multiplied as a whole. But that seems inconsistent with standard problems. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. Let me check: in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems more reasonable. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because any term in the second part would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients from the second part might just add up, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because then the coefficient would depend on the value of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the product. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second expansion are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that's not quite right either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient and variable. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me clarify: The first part is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, each of these would result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4\\), etc. Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficients from the second expansion would be multiplied by 6, not added. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two terms, you multiply their coefficients and combine the variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(6c^4\\), you get \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But wait, that's not quite accurate because the coefficients in the second expansion are for terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products would have a coefficient, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the terms. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient isn't just a single number but includes terms with \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that exists in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part just adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients from these products. So, each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion (64), giving \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part has a coefficient of 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, giving 120. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all terms of the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that might not be correct. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second polynomial, which involves \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, I think that's correct. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Wait, just to be thorough, let me check the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part just contributes a constant factor. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and then it would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (if any) from the second part, because \\(c\\) terms would multiply with other terms, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part must be a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (with the \\(c^0\\) part) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But I think the way I did it before is correct.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand the whole thing, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I guess we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the \\(c\\) expansion, it would still be a separate term involving \\(c\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if such a term exists. Wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that would be the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, is there another way to think about this? Maybe not. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm the calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For the constant term in the second expansion, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right.
