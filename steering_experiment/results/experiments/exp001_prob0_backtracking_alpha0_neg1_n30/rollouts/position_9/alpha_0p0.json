    "text": " Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), that would give me the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so that's 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to multiply the coefficients somehow? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is there something else I'm missing? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6, right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because if you multiply by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a very large number, which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would involve \\(c\\) to some power, which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose that when I multiply the two expansions together, I'll have to consider how each term from the first expansion interacts with each term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means that the part of the expression involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just be a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms just add coefficients but don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit off. Wait, no, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, so each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second expansion will just contribute a scalar multiple to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will give a term like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be when \\(c\\) is raised to any power. But that can't be right because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we might be considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve considering all possible combinations, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be if we were considering the entire product, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is indeed 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we sum all those contributions. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but according to my previous logic, the coefficient would be 2 (from \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) terms) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2). So, 2 times 2 is 4, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, my previous reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in that example, my approach gives 4, but the actual coefficient is zero. Therefore, my earlier reasoning is incorrect. So, I need to rethink this. \n\nWait, in that example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, when you multiply, you get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is indeed zero. But according to my earlier logic, I would have said the coefficient is 2 (from \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) terms) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, giving 4, which is wrong. So, my approach was incorrect. \n\nSo, where did I go wrong? I think I made a mistake in assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. But in reality, that's not the case because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly. Instead, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part just scales it. But in the example, the second part is degree 1, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is degree 4 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part doesn't affect that. Wait, but in the example, the second part is \\((c + 1/c)\\), which when multiplied by \\(a^2\\), gives \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), which doesn't have a \\(b\\) term. Similarly, when multiplied by \\(b^2\\), it gives \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first part and \\(b^2\\) from the first part, but that's not how the multiplication works. Wait, no, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, \\(a^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). The only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is if there's a term in the first part that has both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), which is the middle term \\(2ab\\), but when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(2ab(c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(2abc + 2ab/c\\), which still doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, as expected. \n\nSo, in the original problem, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is just a scalar coefficient, say 6, then when I multiply it by each term in the second part, I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, maybe the confusion is whether the second part affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think again. In the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is a scalar multiple (6) times \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nBut in the earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero, but according to this approach, it would be 2 (from \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) terms) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, giving 4, which is wrong. So, that suggests that this approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, so perhaps the mistake is that in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just scaled by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But in the example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first part is only \\((a + b)^2\\), which has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which is correct. \n\nWait, so in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term with coefficient 6. So, when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). When multiplied, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. According to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, zero times the sum of coefficients in the second part is zero, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient in the product is zero, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b"

    "text": " Let me find that term. So, in the expansion, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!)) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how these two parts interact. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are only variables from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then considering that the second part doesn't affect it, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of terms in the product are the products of coefficients from each expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then any term in the product will be of the form (term from first expansion) times (term from second expansion). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second part will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial would be 6 times that term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second polynomial, which does involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Wait, maybe that's it. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a number, without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) because it will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. Expanding this using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, after expanding both parts, I only need to look at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) won't involve \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that all the terms in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it gets multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that result in a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because only those terms would not introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find two things:\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k=2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. Multiplying them together gives 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think what it's asking is, when you expand the entire product, what is the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but it's a separate variable. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, but in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because each term in the second part is a separate term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the product will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate term, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a separate term in the product. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\), because the \\(Q(c)\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), but that's not a single number. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's denote the two parts as separate: \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). The first part, when expanded, has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part has terms involving \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all these terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense either because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But what is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, so perhaps it's just 6, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. That seems more reasonable. Let me confirm this approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms in the first polynomial are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in the second polynomial are in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has coefficient 6*1=6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) has coefficient 6*6=36, and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all these coefficients for all the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384, as I thought earlier. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me write out the expansion more explicitly. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. That is, 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, the term would involve \\(c\\). So, to get a term that's just a constant (so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant), I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because the entire term \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then see if the second part affects it. Let me think. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we need to consider all the terms from the second expansion that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when we multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined only by the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I might have misread. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion would affect the power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m / c^m)\\) or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem as stated is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I misread it. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part is multiplied by the first. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written correctly, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by the first. But that doesn't make sense either because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * (sum of binomial coefficients from the second expansion). But the sum of binomial coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to see if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean 6 times the expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it should specify the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part is multiplied by the first. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. Wait, no, actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), its sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the part from the first factor, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the entire second factor is. But that doesn't make much sense because the second factor is a sum of terms with \\(c\\).

Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a numerical factor, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponents cancel out.

So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how the multiplication affects this term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), perhaps we're considering that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where \\(c^0\\), because that would eliminate the \\(c\\) dependence. So, let me check if that's correct. So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by this constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all the terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient when considering all the terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be present in the product if it's multiplied by a term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it's only present when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe I can consider the entire product and see how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. But only the constant term \\(20\\) in the second will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), which is \\(20a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) in them, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, no, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, that's correct. But let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem specifically says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just 120. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it can only be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so that part is straightforward. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to find the product of these two expansions. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will get multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by the entire second part, it will produce terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps I can consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake by assuming that all coefficients are multiplied by the 6. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm this with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is formed by taking a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiplying them together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure that this is correct by considering an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these, the product is \\(a^2c + 2a b c + b^2c + a^2/c + 2a b /c + b^2/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present here, but wait, that's because in this case, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only up to 2, but the product doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second part doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, maybe my earlier approach is flawed. Because in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the constant term in the second part. Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term in the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that changes things. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, earlier, I thought it was 384, but that was incorrect because I was considering all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term in the second part contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me verify this with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), we get \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand the product: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiplying by \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), we get:\n\n- \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nLooking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because all terms have either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, that's confusing. Wait, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the expansion, we have \\(a^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^2\\), \\(2\\), and \\(1/c^2\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect. Wait, no, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to have \\(a^2\\) from the first part and \\(b^2\\) from the first part, but in the second part, we need to have a term that is \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because the second part is \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), so each term in the product will have either \\(c^2\\), \\(2\\), or \\(1/c^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the product, you have \\(a^2 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\) and \\(b^2 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually come from \\(a^2 \\times b^2 \\times 2\\), but wait, no, because in the product, you have \\(a^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and similarly \\(b^2\\) multiplied by each term. Wait, no, actually, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first part by \\(b^2\\) from the first part, but that's not possible because each term in the product is a combination of one term from each expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. The product is \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). So, each term in the product is formed by taking one term from \\((a + b)^2\\) and one term from \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) and multiplying them together. So, to get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first part by \\(b^2\\) from the first part, but that's not possible because you can only take one term from each expansion. So, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot be formed because you can only take one term from each expansion, so you can only get terms like \\(a^2 \\times c^2\\), \\(a^2 \\times 2\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2\\), \\(2ab \\times c^2\\), \\(2ab \\times 2\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2\\), \\(b^2 \\times c^2\\), \\(b^2 \\times 2\\), \\(b^2 \\times 1/c^2\\). So, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, which contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought the coefficient would be 2. Hmm, this suggests that my earlier reasoning is flawed. So, perhaps I need to rethink this. Let me go back. The original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, in my small example, I used \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), and the product didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't multiply two terms from the first expansion to get \\(a^2b^2\\) while also having a term from the second expansion. So, perhaps in the original problem, the situation is different. Wait, in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a term \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). So, that term exists in the product. So, in the small example, maybe I made a mistake because \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of one term from each expansion. But in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\), so their product will have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients of these two terms. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but in my small example, the product didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which suggests that perhaps my reasoning is correct only when the first expansion has a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the case of \\((a + b)^2\\) it doesn't. Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2\\) does have a term \\(a^2\\) and a term \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, it results in an \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't change the variables. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find the constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need this exponent to be 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(20\\) as the constant term, so multiplying them together, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(b^k\\) would be \\(b^2\\), and then \\(a^{4 - 2}\\) would be \\(a^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the corresponding term in the second part. Wait, but hold on, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think I might be misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them out, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only from the first part, and the second part might contribute a constant term, or maybe not? Wait, no, because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might complicate things. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the product as a whole, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term in the expansion, and the coefficient would include any terms from the second part that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), but if we're looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), then \"something\" must be 1, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, because then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), again using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the product. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That makes me think that maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the other terms in the second expression don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, but wait, that might not be correct because the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but none of them are constants. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion, each of those would have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I'm looking for all the terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let me confirm that approach. If I have two expressions multiplied together, \\(E = (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, using the binomial theorem, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, that calculation seems a bit off. Let me double-check. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(E\\) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), so \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possibilities. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else? For example, if the second expression had a constant term, then that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\), but if there are other terms, maybe with \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), would they contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else? But no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, every term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would contribute. But that's not the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part can only contribute terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but as it is, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each of those would contribute to different terms in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 times 1 (since the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second expansion is 1, when \\(k=0\\)), and similarly for other powers. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, as I thought earlier, is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so that would be 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, which would be the sum of all coefficients, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I think I'm confusing the problem.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem was just \\((a + b)^4\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems very high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), or is it looking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? Because in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem would probably specify if it wanted the sum of coefficients across different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify what exactly the problem is asking for. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would imply that we're considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean adding up all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems very high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I need to check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the answer is 384. But that seems too large, and I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because the problem is not specific about the power of \\(c\\). Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that we"

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, okay, so when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only involves \\(c\\), the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will only affect the coefficients of the terms in the first polynomial, not their variables. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. However, since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the variables in each term of the second part are only \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficients add up. \n\nLet me think again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(C \\cdot c^k\\) where \\(C\\) is a coefficient. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(C \\cdot c^k\\), you get \\(6C a^2b^2 c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\), so when you add them all up, you get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to find this, I need to compute the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that is multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me expand both expressions separately and see how they multiply. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and the second expansion only contributes a factor that affects the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't sound right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), you need to consider all possible terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and for each such term, the coefficient is multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is the product of 6 and the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. \n\nSo, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times c^k. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). \n\nSince Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have P(a, b) = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, P(a, b) is (a + b)^2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2, and \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1. So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be zero because there's no such term. But according to the method I used earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is zero, so the total coefficient would be zero times sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 2, so zero. That checks out. \n\nAnother example: Let me take P(a, b) = (a + b)^1 = a + b, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which matches the method. \n\nWait, maybe I should try a case where the coefficient isn't zero. Let me take P(a, b) = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2. Then, the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But according to my method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is zero, so the total coefficient is zero times sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is (1 + 1)^2 = 4, so zero. Correct. \n\nWait, perhaps another example where the coefficient isn't zero. Let me take P(a, b) = (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product is (a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)(c + 1/c). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 3 * 1 = 3, because in P(a, b), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) is 3, and when multiplied by Q(c), which has coefficients 1 and 1, so 3*(1 + 1) = 6? Wait, no, that's not right because in the product, each term is multiplied by each term in Q(c). Wait, actually, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but according to my method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is zero, so the total coefficient is zero times sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 2, so zero. But in reality, the product doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients that sum up to 64 when c = 1. Therefore, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and confirm the sum of coefficients. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, I'll go with 384 as the coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, so the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. That means when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\), because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion would include all the terms with \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second part. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless \\(c^0\\) is present. Let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, for the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, from earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression by the constant term (which is 20) from the second expression. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of the coefficients, since the variables don't interfere. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that looks a bit more complicated. But maybe I can also expand that using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is the same as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the second expansion, there are terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, does that affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are combined with the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second expansion as a scalar multiplier for the first part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times each term in the second expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, unless we're looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be treated as a scalar, but that seems incorrect because it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a sum of multiple terms, each multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the coefficient of a term in a product is usually a single number, not a sum of terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is multiplied together, but only looking at the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient equal to 6 times \\(2^6\\), since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when expanded has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second expansion can be treated as a single term, so the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied, not added. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should consider the entire expression and think about how the terms combine. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) will be present, as well as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of the terms from the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) and different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would actually be a sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^{\\text{something}}\\). So, if we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Alternatively, if we're only looking for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, then the coefficient would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) power. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just 6, the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is being treated as a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as a product, so the coefficients should multiply. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression is just a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is more likely expecting me to consider the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a product, and thus the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. I think that makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the total coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's separate. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if the first part gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), then the entire expression's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is from the second part. Wait, but hold on, the second part is raised to the 6th power. Let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly.\n\nWait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by the first part. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second part don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient will actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part is just a separate expansion, but we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm confusing things. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but only focusing on \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Wait, no, actually, the expression is a product of two separate expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms from each will combine. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by each coefficient. Wait, but that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, when considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that might not be correct because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is a separate polynomial. Wait, that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a single coefficient, meaning that perhaps the problem is considering all terms, but only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would contribute a factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that seems like it would be the case if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for different \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second part is just the value of the second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe it's just 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, and we're only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. Usually, when you have multiple variables, you specify all the variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, this would involve finding the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let me think about this.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the second part is multiplied by the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part would contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning where I considered \\(c^0\\). Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all possible terms in \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would just be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients do combine. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(c + d\\), so the coefficient isn't just 1. Therefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \"in\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be "

But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire sum of coefficients, which is 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. \n\nAlright, so let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), since any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me see, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, which is the product of two binomial expansions. So, maybe I should first find the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and then multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part, but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But actually, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) only if the second term is a constant term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each of those products would be separate terms in the overall expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), the product terms would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when you multiply this term by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will be terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term in }c)\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only way the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only that term will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this part. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right. Let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720 divided by 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20c^0\\), which is just 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficients multiply when the variables match. But in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (c^0) from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients to be sure. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems right because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is a well-known value, which is 20. \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the constant term comes only from the second part because any other terms involving \\(c\\) would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, the only contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients, let me verify them again. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

The problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider any other terms in the expansion. The other terms would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interact. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion.

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Do I need to consider that as well? Hmm, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the second part, there are only \\(c\\) terms, so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms.

Because when you multiply by the second part, you're just adding more terms, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient doesn't change. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about it another way. If I expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the specific terms we're interested in. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for a term that included both \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), then I would have needed to consider the product of coefficients. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check. Let me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and see. \n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, in the final expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second part contributes a coefficient of 1 for \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't get multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, so in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the middle term. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which has a coefficient of 6) will be multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought the coefficient was just 6, but actually, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me verify that again. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20\\) as the constant term. So, when you multiply these two together, \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making it a different term. So, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't confuse the exponents. So, in the first expansion, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). In the second expansion, the term is \\(20\\). So, multiplying them together gives \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my initial thought that it was 6 was incorrect because I didn't consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets scaled by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3.

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm not sure if the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affects this. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient should just be 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the entire coefficient is just 6. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so any term from the second expansion would just be a constant multiplier for the terms in the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in the second expansion isn't a single number; it's a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part might also contribute to the coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product's expansion includes terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so yes, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expansion and looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. \n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{sum of all terms in the second expansion}\\right)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion, because each of them will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, we're looking for a specific term in the product. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first polynomial, the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. The first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But actually, looking at the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2/c\\) is also 1, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * 2. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first expansion is 2, and in the product, it would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4. Indeed, in the product, the terms are \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), so coefficients are 2 and 2, totaling 4. \n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we calculated earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the cross terms can affect the coefficients, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so every term in the second polynomial will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to its coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient becomes 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. When multiplying the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then considering their product. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), gives the sum of its coefficients as \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Hmm, let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\) terms. So, I might need to consider the entire product, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that. \n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the only way a term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables will combine. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? Or is there a specific power of \\(c\\) that I'm supposed to consider? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, I need to find all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and sum up their coefficients. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. If I have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, when I expand the product, the terms will be products of the terms from each expansion. So, for example, a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient, and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, say, \\(c^k\\) times its coefficient. When multiplied together, you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with the product of the coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all such terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems too straightforward, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the problem would have mentioned \"regardless of the power of \\(c\\)\". So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nLet me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nFrom earlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms, and just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, that would give me all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe that's not the case. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, no, that would be if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the expansion will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by considering the expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider that. But since it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's referring to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), as that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems contradictory to my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) will be multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would include all possible multiples of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of multiple variables, usually means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), unless specified otherwise. So, perhaps the problem expects me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, I get \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 if \\(c = 1\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it's 1 (from \\(a * 1/c * c = a\\), but that's not correct because \\(a * 1/c * c = a\\), which is \\(a^1c^0\\), but that's not the same as \\(a^1b^0c^0\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems to contradict my earlier conclusion of 120.\n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's different. So, I think the problem is ambiguous. However, given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Because if it were asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would probably specify that. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 1 (from \\(a * 1/c * c = a\\)). So, in that case, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if it asked for \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1. So, in our original problem, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. But I think the intended interpretation is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the only variables, and \\(c\\) is just another term, but I don't think that's the case. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when multiplied together, the term is \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will depend on the coefficients from both parts. \n\nLet me think. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so it doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because actually, the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficients from both parts. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expression? That can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, the coefficient will be 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense either. Because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is multiplied, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a very large number, which seems unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is more complex, and I need to consider that the second expansion could affect the coefficient in some way. \n\nWait, no, I think I was right the first time. Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only involves \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing things. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not the case because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that's only if we're considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. Therefore, when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, perhaps we're supposed to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not entirely confident about this approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I should try expanding both parts separately and see how they interact. Let's start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). As we did earlier, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and we're summing the coefficients of all such terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the products of the coefficients from the second expansion and the coefficient from the first expansion. But since the coefficient from the first expansion is 6, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not straightforward. However, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Similarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, which has multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those terms. So, the coefficient isn't just 6; it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't matter? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider all the possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion. So, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a monomial, not just a coefficient. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and also \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), there's no \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, is that the answer?\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms, each with their own coefficients. When you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it differently. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I don't separate the variables. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of two expressions. So, technically, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), we can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the relevant terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, it's multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out). So, actually, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, so that changes things. I thought I could ignore the second part, but actually, I need to consider the constant term in the second expansion because when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the constant term in the second expression. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, we're left with the constant term from the second part. So, I think that's correct. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20. \n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form (term from first expansion) \u00d7 (term from second expansion). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the possible terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That is, in the expanded form, when you multiply these two expressions, what is the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the two expressions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the second factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is just multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because we're only looking at \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem includes both parts, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second part). But the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me think differently. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second factor, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the second factor will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the entire expansion of the second factor. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second factor, which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product, but without any specific term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because we're not considering any specific power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's expand both expressions separately and see how the coefficients work. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), expands to terms with \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their respective coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each with their coefficients. When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, \\) etc., each with their coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, but in reality, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me calculate that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a sum of terms, each being the coefficient from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by 1 (the constant term), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient would involve the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second polynomial contributes a factor that is multiplied by 1, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) will have a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 1 (since the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second expansion is 1), the term \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) will have a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 15, because the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 15\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so"

But that doesn't seem right because the second part is also being multiplied. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand the second part using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) from the second polynomial. So, yes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that perhaps the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think about that. When we multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, correct. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
