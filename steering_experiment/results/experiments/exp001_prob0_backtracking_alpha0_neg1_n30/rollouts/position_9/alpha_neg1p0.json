    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), that coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms that are products of these terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems a bit broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be possible. Let me check that. So, if I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms of the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\right)\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. But that seems too involved, and the problem might just be expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each of those coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's implied that you're considering the coefficient as a constant, ignoring other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. I'm confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's ambiguous. But maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I think the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I should assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, and the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\), and then multiplying by 6, giving 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's more likely. Let me confirm that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), since \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so 120 is more likely. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, does that mean this part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or maybe I need to consider the entire expression and see how the terms combine. Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or maybe it's considering the entire product, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I need to check the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is just a multiplier. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) part, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, especially since the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the rest is just extra. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. That would make sense because then we'd have to consider both parts. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, what's the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable, and it's a numerical coefficient, which makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm assuming something that's not there. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If I consider the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part. The second part is just a multiplier, so it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems too simple, especially since the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me check with a smaller example to see if that makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it manually: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is \\(a^1b^0\\)) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, my earlier approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients is incorrect because it gives a numerical coefficient, but in reality, the coefficient is a polynomial.\n\nSo, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is just extra. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, but considering that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more reasonable, and it's a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nLet me confirm that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer would be 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm assuming something that's not there. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power"

    "text": " That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, do I need to consider the expansion of that part as well? Hmm, maybe not directly, because the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the overall coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be any term. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the entire expression is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and then the coefficient of that term, which would include the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part as well. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which could be \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), or \\(c^5\\), etc., so each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire second part becomes 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that approach. If I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can affect the exponents. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve terms from both expansions. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's essentially asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), etc. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has coefficient 6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^5\\) also has coefficient 6, and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate polynomial that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 2 times (c + 1/c), because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in this case, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(b^0\\) and \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(a^0\\), so I think I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, no, in this example, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). In this product, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) is also multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero in this case. Wait, but that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) terms from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, does that mean that there is no such term? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense! So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which"

    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part of the expression, right? Because when you multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean that the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the variables are different, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would remain the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other terms involving \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by that coefficient. Wait, is that correct? Or does the entire expression multiply, so the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum is for the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see. \n\nWait, actually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms are independent. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, actually, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of the specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expansion, because the variables are different. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion when multiplying to get the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, any term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 would have their coefficient multiplied by the corresponding term in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be the sum over all possible terms in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can note that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is to consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6, depending on the expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but another perspective: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that's consistent with what I thought before. \n\nLet me confirm the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let me expand it to check. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term with \\(ab\\) would be 2ab * c and 2ab * 1/c, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2/c. But wait, that's a term with variables, not a constant. Hmm, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is not 4, but rather 2(c + 1/c). So, that seems contradictory to my earlier reasoning. \n\nWait, so in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2(c + 1/c), which is not a constant. But in the original problem, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is also a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might be ambiguous. It might be asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that they want the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but in my simpler example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2(c + 1/c), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not an expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps they just want the coefficient as a number, which would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. Let me explore that possibility. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, which interpretation is correct? Hmm. In the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the simpler example I tried earlier, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) was 2(c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that \\(c\\) is a constant, and we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than the problem suggests. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me consider another angle. Let's think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier simpler example, that approach didn't give the correct result when considering the coefficient as a constant. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine that example. \n\nIn the simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2c + 2/c. So, in this case"

But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... wait, but which term in the second expansion? Because the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^0\\) and then negative exponents. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I'm only interested in the constant term in the second expansion, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient.\n\nLet me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, that term is 20, and multiplying that by 6 gives 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense. I don't think I'm missing any steps here. So, I'm pretty confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient remains 6 regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. \n\nNo, wait a second. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient. \n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second expansion. So, that's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? I don't think so because any term involving \\(c\\) would mean that the term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would have to be multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only contribution is from the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about the entire expansion. The first part gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part gives terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the only term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Now, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we only need the constant term from the second part? Wait, no, because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it will still be part of the product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but in the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{k'}c^m\\) or something like that. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from each expansion. So, for example, a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could be \\(c^3\\) with some coefficient, so the product would be \\(6a^2b^2c^3\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so how can we have a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponents. So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, in order for the product term to have no \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) in the term from the second expansion must be zero. That is, the term must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term. Let me find that term. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is it correct to multiply the coefficients directly? Let me think again. The first part gives me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and coefficient 6, and the second part gives me a term with \\(c^0\\) and coefficient 20. When I multiply these two terms together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since we're only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, and \\(c\\) has exponent 0, then the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each respective part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply only if the variables match. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their terms won't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, let me make sure. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since the variables are different, the only way the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think we have to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, but in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That might make more sense. So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, let me think. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, because that's the coefficient from the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a scalar. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiply these together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that polynomial, meaning that the coefficient itself is a polynomial. But the problem asks for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a scalar, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not what is being asked. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) in them, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Therefore, the answer is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just go through it one more time to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, coefficient is 6. \n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, the answer is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the variables are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when you have two separate variables, like \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part and \\(c\\) in the other, the coefficients of terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as part of the same term, and \\(c\\) as another part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that.\n\nSo, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to the constant term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to be present without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand the entire product, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would look like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\), as I found earlier. Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, the term from the second part can be any term, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that approach would be correct if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, so that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, in this case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is present, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the same regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is a separate polynomial. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let me write out the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Let me think about a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, but that's not a number. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient isn't a number but a polynomial. But in the original problem, it's asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in the second polynomial when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, if I set c = 1, then (c + 1/c)^1 = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Because when you set c = 1, the second polynomial becomes 64, and that's the sum of its coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, when I set c = 1, the product becomes (a + b)(2) = 2a + 2b, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which matches the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, in the original problem, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^"

Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that in the expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you have a term with \\(c^k\\) and another with \\(c^{-k}\\), their product would be a constant. Wait, no, actually, let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are independent, so when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). So, 6 choose 3 is 20, right? Because 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 / 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 / 6 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, their product is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. If I had terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), those would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for. Therefore, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, multiplied by 6 from the first part. So, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only dependent on the first part of the product, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which is only in terms of \\(c\\).

Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is a single term, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it will create terms that include \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor adds more variables. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second factor, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second expression only has \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? Or is the problem perhaps asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Because if that's the case, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be different. But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because every term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both parts, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, and when you multiply by the second factor, each term in the second factor will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first factor times the sum of the coefficients in the second factor. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second factor is 64, as I found earlier, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both expressions and see. Let me try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider cross terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would have to find the term in the second part where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes problems ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the sum would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But given the problem as stated, I think 384 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When multiplied, each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, in other words, I need the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from the first binomial) multiplied by 20 (from the second binomial). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I think I got it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2.

    "text": " That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean the entire coefficient from the second part just multiplies the 6 we found earlier? Let me think. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need the term in the second expression that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then will multiplying by that term not change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I find that constant term, its coefficient will multiply the 6 from the first part to give the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I correctly expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, I correctly identified that I needed the constant term from the second part because we're looking for a term without \\(c\\). I applied the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), found that the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and calculated the coefficient as 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if I need to consider that as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6? Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to consider the entire expression, including the second part. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be 6 times that expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would still be 6, because when you multiply by the second part, you're adding more variables, but the coefficient for the specific \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains 6. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because when you expand the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 times the entire second polynomial, but since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, it's just 6. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will have a term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, unless there's a constant term in the second polynomial. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, does it? Let me check. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second polynomial is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the first polynomial by the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second polynomial, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm seeing that it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how this term arises in the product. Since the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(20\\) (the constant term), then when we multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about it differently. The entire expression is the product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term (the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power) in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial has a constant term of 20, the overall coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). 3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct.

But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a constant. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial. So, let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and not considering the second part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, because the variables are different. So, when you multiply two polynomials with different variables, the coefficients multiply, but the variables are separate. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the term \\(a c\\) would have coefficient 1*1=1, \\(a d\\) would be 1*1=1, etc. So, in our case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's explore that. First, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was if we considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be if we set \\(c = 1\\). But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most problems like this, unless specified, they usually ask for the coefficient of a specific term, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the answer is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or does it affect the coefficient somehow? Hmm, I think since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then we multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficients from the two parts would multiply together. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\) would, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it's only the constant term in the second expansion that contributes to that. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem.

Now, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion will just be the same as the coefficient in the first expansion multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's sufficient to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be the case. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just the coefficient, so the sum is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't the case. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all those products. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and each such term will have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that can't be, because the coefficient can't be a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, as I thought earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) in the second expansion gives the sum of coefficients, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me check this another way. Let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would imply that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Because if there's any power of \\(c\\) left, then the term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by the terms from the second expression. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by a term from the second part, say \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., where \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k - 6 = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me calculate that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so if the second part contributes a constant term, then the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives a coefficient of 20 for the constant term, then when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and look for all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) terms are only in the second part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part.

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient we just found, 6, is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes all the terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is just 6, right? Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (or any constant term in the second expansion). But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to 6. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, for there to be a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the second expansion has a constant term of 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The general term in this expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think about it. So, when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if there are any terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. Wait, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire product would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms will contribute to the overall product. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Wait, does that mean we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or perhaps, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we need to sum all those contributions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That might make sense too, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not typical. So perhaps, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, I need to clarify that. Let me assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Then, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's a bit ambiguous. Also, in the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, which is a bit confusing. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, I think my initial approach is correct, and the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about it another way. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. However, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. So, which one is correct? Let me try to clarify. When the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is determined by the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). That would mean, for each term in the second expansion, the coefficient is multiplied by 6, and then all those are summed up. \n\nBut wait, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's a bit non-standard to ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying all variables. So, in that case, the answer would be 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the second interpretation is more likely intended. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would include all these terms, meaning the coefficient is the sum of all these coefficients. So, that would be 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. \n\nBut that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's just 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be 384, which is a much larger number, and it's not clear that the problem wants that. Also, in the context of such problems, usually, if they don't specify all variables, they might be referring to the term where the exponents of the other variables are zero. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's implied that \\(c^0\\) is the exponent. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but to confirm, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). If I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Alternatively, if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a\\) times all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. \n\nWait, in this small example, if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), it would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it's 1*1 = 1. \n\nSo, in the original problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when multiple variables are present, unless specified, it's usually implied that the coefficient is for the term where the other variables have exponent zero. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

    "text": " That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, in the expansion, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I have to consider the second part as well? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part? Let me think. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how that term interacts with the second part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we are to find the coefficient when considering the entire expression, but perhaps only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would involve various powers of \\(c\\). Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Since the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but each term in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), etc., up to \\(c^0\\) and negative exponents. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would exist without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me calculate that. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I correctly identified that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right.

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and then we're multiplying by another expression which only involves \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (or the constant term) in the second expansion. Because if it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), then the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by this constant term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. So, the first part gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a constant term of 20, so when you multiply these together, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. But wait, does the entire expression multiply each term? So, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because the second expansion only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, any term in the second expansion would either increase or decrease the exponent of \\(c\\), but not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply by the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's it. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4 choose 2, which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because \\(c\\) is a different variable. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, when we expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable and considering the entire expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps we're supposed to consider the coefficient in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the expression is a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply out the entire expression, we'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just being multiplied, so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when we multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have two separate variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient in the second part. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), maybe it's expecting the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second part. So, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and ignores the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Let me try to approach this more methodically. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the two parts separately because \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at the variable equal to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems to make sense. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, then it's 6, but given that the entire expression includes both parts, I think the correct answer is 384. Let me double-check this reasoning. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is 64. When you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second part, effectively summing all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the terms from the first polynomial are independent of the terms in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\). So, that simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term. But since the second part is multiplied by this, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to do that, I need to find the term where in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and in the second part, the term is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both parts. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term. It just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the answer would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Let me try that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients, but I think the way I did it is correct. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} \\times (1 + 1) = 1 \\times 2 = 2\\). If I expand it, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2 times the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, but wait, in this case, the second part is degree 0 in c, so it's just 2 times 2, which is 4? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in the expansion, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, the \\(2ab\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and the \\(b^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't actually exist because there's no term where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. Wait, so maybe my initial approach was wrong. Because in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting terms would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(c^0\\), right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is not 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but rather 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I initially misunderstood the problem. I thought the entire expression would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all terms, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\) to not change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me double-check this. If I consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in this expansion is multiplied by each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) expansion. So, the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, ..., down to 6a\u00b2b\u00b2(1/c)^6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, yes, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I need to find the product of the two expansions. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables. Wait, let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different; they don't interfere with each other. That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expansion includes all the terms with \\(c\\), when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're effectively looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(1/c^2\\), etc. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when we multiply this by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything else. Wait, but that can't be, because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're to find the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the 6a^2b^2 term. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, as I thought before, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), because in the second expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me check once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has 7 terms, each with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), up to \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). The sum of these coefficients is \\(2^6=64\\). Therefore, when you multiply 6 by 64, you get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients in this part is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Therefore, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we might need to consider the sum of all those products where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get a term that includes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute to the \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present as part of these multiplied terms, but without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Wait, no, because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, in the entire product, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\); instead, every term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) also has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually zero because there is no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the second factor only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you end up with terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm that. Let me think of it another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms from each polynomial are multiplied together. Since the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\), the resulting product will have terms that are products of terms from each. Therefore, any term in the product will have exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would require that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning the term from the second polynomial must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), what is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)? That would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was zero, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me check again. \n\nIf I consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 1, then the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the second polynomial doesn't have any terms without \\(c\\), but actually, it does have a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the coefficient was zero. Instead, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's only the first part of the expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms would have to be raised to some power such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, essentially, any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc., and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the 6 from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think the more likely interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120 is the answer. Let me confirm this by considering how the multiplication works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of the coefficients of all these terms multiplied by 6. But wait, no, actually, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term from the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. But the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 384. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you have multiple variables, usually when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's implied that you're considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, to be thorough, perhaps I should compute both possibilities and see which one makes sense. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) first. As I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6*20=120. Now, if I compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6=64\\), then 6*64=384. So, which one is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's in the product, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, that would be the case if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how such questions are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions with multiple variables, it's often looking for the term where all variables have specific exponents. So, if they just say \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), it might be implying that \\(c\\) is not involved, which would mean that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*20=120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended answer is 120. But to make sure, let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6, which is 6*64=384. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you specify all the exponents. So, I think the more reasonable interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"
