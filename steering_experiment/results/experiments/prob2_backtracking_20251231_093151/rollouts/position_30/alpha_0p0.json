    "text": " Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in the 488th number (since 488 ends with 8, not 4). Wait, no, 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then the 488th number is 488, which ends with 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last hundred, which only goes up to 488. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 10 +10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 fours. Wait, but does the hundreds digit ever have an 8? Let me check. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, for 4's, total is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book ends at 488. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 10 fours in the tens place for each hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last hundred is 401-488. So, does that affect the tens place counts? Wait, in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set (480-488). Each full set is 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, totaling 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89 eights. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 40, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 40 = 89 eights.

From 1-400, we have 4 blocks of 100: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, total fours: 188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units:49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me think again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for the last block. So, 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. That's correct. Units place eights:49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. So, fours:188, eights:98, difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 blocks * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = **49** times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Wait, that can't be right because 49+50 is 99, and 99+89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

Now, the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be the next set, but since 488 is the last page, we have 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so total number is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is the 48th set, but 488 is 488, which ends with 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. Let's count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,...,488. Since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I counted correctly. Hmm, maybe. Now, moving on to 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check. Units: 8,18,...,488: 49. Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So 49 +50 +89=188 fours. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Wait, but let me think again: is 488 included in the units place? Yes, 488 is 8 in the units place, so that's counted in the 49 eights. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, which is counted as 8 in the tens place. Wait, no: 488 has 8 in the tens and units place, but when counting the tens place, we're only counting the 8 in the tens digit, so 480-488: each number has 8 in the tens place, so 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So that's correct. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let me list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so it's 9 numbers.

So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add one more? Let me count: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last occurrence is 488, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again to be sure. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.

Let's count how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because 188 seems high for fours. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing a 4 in the units place, plus the 484, which is the 49th. So yes, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place? From 1-400, we have 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. Let me just cross-verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=90. Seems correct.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the 49th occurrence (8, 18, ..., 488), so units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349) and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is another 10, making it 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, so 4*10=40. 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.

    "text": " But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Actually, the hundreds place is 4 for numbers from 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400-488). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me check: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these calculations. Let me recount the fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: same as fours, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so total eights=49+49=98.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.

    "text": " So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 after that. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full decades. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one. The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many terms are there? The sequence is 8, 18, ..., 488. The nth term can be expressed as 8 + (n-1)*10. We set this equal to 488: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which contributes 9. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480, 481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50. That's correct. And hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Units place for 4's is from 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

So, 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, no: 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so the count is 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98.

Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: same as fours, which would be 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but wait a second, when counting the tens place for eights, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. For the tens place, the eights are in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full decades and a partial one. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. Fours: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, total 188. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have overcounted. Let me think again: for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. So, yes, 89 fours there. So, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each of these blocks (except the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers (except the last one) has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers here? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
