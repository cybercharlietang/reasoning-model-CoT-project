    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and the partial one. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 full blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? Let me count: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, the tens place 8's are: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I considered 480-488, I thought there are 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 49 in tens place. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but we're only counting the hundreds digit as 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting at 8, each 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets and the partial set. Each full set (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, how many full sets are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 more eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last partial block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. To find the count: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these sets contributes 10 eights except possibly the last one. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: That's 49 numbers, so 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th number because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? Let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

So, total number of fours is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (488-480+1=9). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8.

I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each set (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 such sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the first four sets, each contributes 10 eights, but the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check my counting again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights.

Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me check if I made a mistake. Wait, 4 in the hundreds place is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see, the last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: 188 fours and 98 eights. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488.

But wait, 480-488 is another set, but only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but is 480-488 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, tens place has 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units + tens: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n - 6. Wait, actually, 4 + 10(n-1) = 10n -6. Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that the first term is 4, which is 4 + 10*0, and the last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(k-1) = 484. So, 10*(k-1) = 480, so k-1=48, so k=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(k-1) = 488. So, 10*(k-1) = 480, so k-1=48, so k=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The number of such occurrences is calculated by considering the sequence from 4 to 484, which gives 49 instances.\n   - **Tens Place (10s):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 instances, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 instances.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s):** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 instances.\n   - **Tens Place (10s):** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 instances.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s):** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these sets has 10 numbers. How many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89 is within 1-488, same with 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in the hundreds place. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 instead of 10. So total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I did everything right.

Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, no, 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So that's 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488. So, 40 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place for 8 in the 400s is 9, not 10. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. Tens place for 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. And for 8's in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds for 8's, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, then every 10 after that. The last one is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term can be expressed as 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-489 would be 10, but the book stops at 488, so only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would be part of it. So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place calculation. For the tens digit being 8, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if the book ends before the next set.\n\nWait, the book ends at 488, so in the hundreds place, 400-488. The tens digit being 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nLet me count:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 10*4 +9=49, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188-98=90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So total tens place is 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nSo total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book ends at 488, there's no page 800, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe I should write a small table for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo find this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we start counting from 8 as the first, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which is only up to 488. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 49 +50 +89=188. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - '8' appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, total fours are units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last)\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights are units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488.

So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right because each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive. The count is 488 -400 +1=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the fours were in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences, right?

So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 48 fours, but since 488 is included, that's 49 fours. So that's correct. In the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. So that's correct. In the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 48 eights, but since 488 is included, that's 49 eights. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 of them. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 fours. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49 eights. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49 eights, correct. So, total eights:98, fours:188. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (since 440-449 is within 488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block (480-488), which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Adding them up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last one is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

Let's check each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488)\n\nWait, wait, that's not correct. 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place in the hundreds of 400-499 would have 10 numbers if we went up to 489, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow for the eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for the eights. Since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's count the number of eights in each position again.\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me list how many:\n\nFrom 1-99: 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 10 eights.\n\nFrom 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 eights.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208,...,298:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:308,...,398:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: that's 9 eights.\n\nSo total units place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nTens place eights:\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9 numbers.\n\nSo total tens place eights:10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, as before.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block contributes 10 except the last, which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as 800-899 exceeds 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but each of those contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, that's 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, no, 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers? Wait, let's check: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488), which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. And units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. Okay, seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 400-488 is correct. So, hundreds place gives 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more for the 484, making it 49. So, units: 49. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, not a full hundred. So, for the tens place, in each full hundred, there are 10 fours. So, from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10. Then, in 400-488, how many tens digits are 4? From 400-409, that's 10 numbers, but 400-488 is up to 488, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 410-488 doesn't have any more tens digit 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 10 in 400-409, totaling 50. So, tens:50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, plus one more for 488, making it 49. So, units:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), right? Let me count each block. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10. 400-488:480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds:0. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.
