    "text": " So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so let's check: from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Wait, let me think again. The tens digit being 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges except the last one has 10 numbers. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4 (since 488 is 4 in the hundreds place). So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10, and 480-488 contributes 9, so \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, if I consider 4 as the first, then 14 is the second, and so on, up to 484, which would be the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. The 8 appears in the units place as 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For units place, 49 numbers, as 484 is included. For 8's, units place 49, tens place 49 (including 480-488 as 9 numbers). So, 98 total 8's. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, the units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, right? Let me calculate how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each hundred, the tens place has a 4 in the 40-49 range. So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, from 401-488, the tens place can also have a 4 in 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because 400-499 would be the next hundred, but our book stops at 488, so the tens place in 440-449 is still within 401-488. So, actually, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449. So, that's 5 sets: 40-49 (1-100), 140-149 (101-200), 240-249 (201-300), 340-349 (301-400), and 440-449 (401-500, but our book stops at 488, so 440-449 is still within 401-488). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but in the 400s, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within our range. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each of these sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 80-89 (1-100), 180-189 (101-200), 280-289 (201-300), 380-389 (301-400), and 480-488 (401-500, but our book ends at 488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 occurs in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, the first four sets are full 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought it was 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me recount: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10), and 480-488(9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That also seems correct. Units place: fours from 4,14,...,484. Let me check how many numbers that is. The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, yes, 0. So, total fours=188, eights=98. Difference=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, and the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, first four blocks are complete: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, no 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems too high.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right. For 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 and 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, 188-98=90.

The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to a certain number can be calculated by dividing the number by 10 and taking the floor of that. So, for 488, the number of 4's in the units place would be floor(488/10) = 48. But since 488 is the last page, and 488's units digit is 8, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, but 4, 14, ..., 484 is 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th number. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the count. Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. However, wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all five ranges are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate: floor(488/10)=48. But 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, similar to the 4's, 8 appears in the units place 49 times. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, and the last partial range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four full ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This gives 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal occurrences of 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal occurrences of 8: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (another), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there?

    "text": " Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 48th group (since 484 = 48*10 + 4). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula: the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of it as for each position, the count is based on higher digits. Let me try a different approach. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to how many times 4 appears in the ones place from 1 to 488. So, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 are the remaining 8 numbers. In those, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 48 +1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times. Similarly, for the tens place: the 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 again in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So total in the tens place: 4*10 +10=50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50. Now, the hundreds place: 4 can appear in the hundreds place as 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, but let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Let me think: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place as 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place:0. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting, especially with the ranges. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total:188. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) full groups, each contributing one 4.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then each hundred has another 10, so 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's an additional 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last number is 488, so the units place 4's go up to 484, which is 48 times. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me count differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in each 10-number block. So, in each block of 10 (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), 4 appears once in the units place. So, the total number of such blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? No, because in each block, the 4 in the units place occurs once, regardless of the block's end. So, from 1-480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, it's 49 times. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count these ranges. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me count how many times. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 occurs 49 times? Let me check: from 1-480, there are 48 occurrences, and then 488 adds one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 times. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last number, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - **Total:** 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- **Total:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The formula for counting digits in a specific place is to take the higher digits, then the current digit, then the lower digits. But maybe it's easier to just list them out mentally. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's once every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488) where the units digit is 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included. But 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers. 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times 4 appears in the units place from 4,14,...,474. Then, from 475 to 488, the units digits go from 5 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. How many such groups are there up to 488? Let's see. The first group is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is the 440th page, and 449 is the 449th. Then, from 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds place is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). But wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the last group from 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. In each full cycle of 10, there's one 8. So, 48 x 1 = 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This happens in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens group. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total in the tens place: 4 groups of 10 and one group of 9. So, 4x10 +9=49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 4x10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the hundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: every 10 numbers, 48 times, since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, and the last group doesn't add another 4. So, 48. Correct. For 8's: units place: 49, because 488 is included, so 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 groups, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4x10 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (4, 14, ..., 474).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in groups like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many complete sets of 100 we have in 488 pages. From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but 500 is beyond 488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the last set is 401-488. Let me correct that. So, the ranges where the tens digit is 4 are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the last set, 440-449, all numbers are within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place that have 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10). So, for n=488, it's floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. So, 48 times. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is only up to 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). However, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, in the 440-449 block, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 blocks are complete. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's. The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? Using the same formula, floor((488 +1)/10)= floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Wait, earlier for 4's, I thought it was 48, but now for 8's, it's 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm. For 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. But earlier I thought it was 48, which was incorrect. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times. So, I must have miscalculated earlier. So, units place: 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 40+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's. Wait, wait, no, 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188? Wait, no, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, earlier I thought 4's were 187. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recount. Units place for 4: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Tens place for 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place for 4: 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total 49+50+89=188. So, 4 appears 188 times. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, now I'm getting 90. Hmm, earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now I see that 4's are actually 188, so 188-98=90. So, the correct difference is 90. Let me check the 4's again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. Yes. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 4's were 187. It's actually 188.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that makes sense. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. But wait, the last block is 400-488, which only goes up to 488, so the tens place in 400-488 is 4 for 400-409, 10-19 in the tens place? Wait no, 400-488: the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, then 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this. The tens digit is 4 in the block 400-409, which is 10 numbers: 400-409. But wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 400 is included, so that's 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 410-419: the tens digit is 1, so that's not 4. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the places. Let me clarify: For the tens place, the 4 can be in the tens digit regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. In 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Adding it all up: Units place:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences except possibly the last one. Let's check: From 0-99:80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189, 10. 200-299:280-289,10. 300-399:380-389,10. 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10) and one block contributing 9. So total:4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, no, that's for specific digits. Let me think again. For units place, the number of 4's from 1 to 488 is the number of times 4 appears in the ones place. So, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But since 488 is the last page, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. In those 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place beyond 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48, which would give 48 occurrences. But 484 is the last number where 4 is in the units place, which is the 49th occurrence? No, wait, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me count how many numbers: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me check with a smaller number. Suppose N=14. How many 4's in units place? 4 and 14, so 2 times. Using the formula floor(14/10)=1, but we have 2 occurrences. So, the correct formula is floor((N + 1)/10). Wait, (14 +1)/10=1.5, floor is 1, which still doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as for units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) times 1, plus 1 if the units digit of N is >= d. So, for N=488, units digit is 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1. So, number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) +1 =48 +1=49. Okay, that makes sense. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is also there, but the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, not 4. So, let's calculate how many full groups of 100 we have. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total 50 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 times total. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, counting the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1-488? Using the same method as for 4. The number is floor(488/10)=48, and since the units digit of 488 is 8, which is equal to 8, we add 1. So, 48 +1=49 times. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times. Each full hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 +9=49 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, this happens 48 times, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 40-49 contribute 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds and one partial (400-488), adding 10 more, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 80-89 contribute 10 times. With 4 full hundreds and 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 in the units place occurs 49 times? Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, how many numbers in each range? - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's correct. So, total 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98 times. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the digit 4 in the hundreds place. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the counts again. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. For example, in the hundreds place for 8, it's zero because the book only goes up to 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Correct. Similarly, for 4's, the hundreds place is only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, we have 40-49 (10 numbers). In 100-200, 140-149 (another 10). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last range. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8, but let me check each range. Each full hundred has 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 ranges (1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, 400-488: the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such ranges.  \n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I was wrong before. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (n // 10) + 1 if the last number is included. Let me think. For the units place, in each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which gives 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 481-488. But in the units place, 484 is within this block, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the first 480 numbers) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, we can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, totaling 48. But wait, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th number in the units place where the digit is 8. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block is incomplete because it ends at 488 instead of 489. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each full block contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, so 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full blocks and one incomplete block (480-488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, I can think of it as for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, which gives 48 fours in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, but if I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48.8, meaning 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the 49th 4 comes at 484. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and the 49th at 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial range contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total.

But wait, the last set is from 481 to 490, but our book ends at 488, so the last set is incomplete. However, the units digit 4 appears once in each complete set, so 48 times. But wait, let's check from 1 to 488: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 0-9: no, 40-49 is the first. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be for page numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The first occurrence is at 8, the last at 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place would be in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 complete ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be for page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me calculate that: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 ranges are fully included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for each ten, there's one 4. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full tens (10-90, 100-190, etc.) plus the 480-488 range, which has one more 4 at 484. So, 48 full tens contribute 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. So, in each hundred, except maybe the last one, there's a full set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, right? Wait, no, 80-89 is 10 numbers (80,81,...,89). Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many in the tens place? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check: from 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, right? Each of those has an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. For 4's, in the tens place, I had 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). So 5 sets, each 10, total 50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yeah, that makes sense. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. Each block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then the 49th occurrence at 484. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: as above, 5 blocks each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and the 49th occurrence is 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the last cycle is incomplete. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10 numbers) plus any extra in the incomplete set. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 more numbers in the incomplete decade (481-488). In these 8 numbers, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the incomplete decade (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full ranges are there? 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full ranges with 10 each and one with 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. And for 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 488-480+1=9. So that's correct. So the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4 full ranges and one partial, totaling 49. Correct. So yes, 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades and one incomplete decade (481-488). The incomplete decade contributes one more 4. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four full ranges and one partial (480-488), contributing 9. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 can be calculated by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which gives 48. But wait, in the last group, which is 481-490, 484 is included, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think of it as for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such decades there are. From 0-99: 40-49, that's one. From 100-199: 140-149, another. Similarly, up to 400-488: 440-449. So, how many decades are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so the tens place in 400-488 would be 40-48 in the tens place, but 440-449 is fully within 400-488, so that's another decade. Let me count the number of full decades where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is fully included, but 480-488 would have tens digit 8, which is beyond 4. So, yes, 440-449 is the only decade in 400-488 with tens digit 4, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can also have a 4. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 +1=49? Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, 488 is the last one. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in decades like 80-89, 180-189,...,480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last decade is 480-488. So, how many full decades are there? From 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189:10 numbers. From 200-299:280-289:10 numbers. From 300-399:380-389:10 numbers. From 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, total tens place 8's: 4 full decades (each 10) and one partial decade with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount any digits. For example, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 5 decades, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct because 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488. Each of the first four centuries has a full decade (40-49, etc.), and the last one (400-488) has 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. For 8's in tens place, I had 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) and one partial (480-488), which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10+9=49. That seems right. For units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. Wait, but for 4 in units place, I thought it was 49, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10. So, the last one is 484. So, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Similarly for 8, the last is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, both units digits have 49. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them up: 49+50=99, then 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me count: from 0-488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 >=8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so yes, we add 1. So, floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me see how many such blocks are within 1-488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many tens blocks have 8 in the tens place? From 0-399, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers: 4*10=40. From 400-488, the block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers that is. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but in the hundreds place, it's only the 4 in the hundreds digit, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but similar to the 4's, we have to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, yes, it's included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check: 80-89: that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers because from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, 10 each: 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's:49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. The hundreds place for 4's is from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct. For 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this? Maybe by considering that in each digit position, the count should be similar except for the hundreds place. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each, so the difference in units place is 0. In the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so 50-49=1 more 4. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times, so 89 more 4's. So total difference is 1+89=90. That seems to align with my previous calculation. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The blocks are in the ranges: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (another), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks give 5*10=50 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Next, I'll count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers (since 8, 18, ..., 488). So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4). That's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40 numbers. Now, does 480-489 also count? Since the book only goes up to 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, so I need to add these 9 numbers to the previous count. So, tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can't appear in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, so the hundreds digit is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since 8 is higher than 4, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But then, the last partial cycle from 481 to 488 includes 484, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? Let's count how many full decades we have. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. The last partial cycle includes 488, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full decades? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Let me check the tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 full decades and one partial, so 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each, because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except maybe the last partial set. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so for units place 4: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for 8: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated. 8's in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see how many full decades there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many full sets there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389). So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 480-489 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but in the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The tens place 8's occur in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade contributing 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but that's without considering the partial set. So, the correct count is 49 8's in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. From 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's think in terms of hundreds. For hundreds digit 0: 80-89: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10. Hundreds digit 2: 280-289:10. Hundreds digit 3:380-389:10. Hundreds digit 4:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. For 8's in the tens place, I have 49, which seems correct because the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The formula for counting the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to a number N is floor(N/10). But in this case, N is 488, but I'm only considering up to 484 for the units place. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 itself ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th number ending with 4. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. Let's consider the units digit: for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in the range 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full hundreds we have. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, contributing 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another set, another 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, but 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 itself ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. From 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last range contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. But wait, let me double-check my counts because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each digit place again for both fours and eights to make sure I didn't make a mistake. **Counting Fours Again:**\n- Units place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. The last such number is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours.\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours. So, 50 fours.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\n**Counting Eights Again:**\n- Units place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. The last such number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights.\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n- Hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place gives us 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, from 0-99: 10 numbers, 100-199: another 10, 200-299: another 10, 300-399: another 10, and 400-488: from 400-449, that's 50 numbers (40-49 in each hundred, but wait, 400-449 is 50 numbers, right? Wait, 400-449 is 50 numbers because 449 - 400 + 1 = 50. So, in each hundred except the last one, we have 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. But the last hundred is 400-488. So, from 400-449, it's 50 numbers, and from 450-488, the tens digit isn't 4 anymore. So, how many hundreds are there? Let me see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. For the first four sets (0-399), each contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 sets * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, it's 50 numbers (400-449) with 4 in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 40 + 50 = 90 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u219210. 300-399: 340-349 \u219210. 400-488: 400-449 \u219250 numbers. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+50=90 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (90) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 90 = 139, 139 +89=228 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89). So, from 0-99: 10 numbers. 100-199: 10. 200-299:10. 300-399:10. 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, and the last hundred (400-488) contributing 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 228 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 228 - 98 = 130. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=90, hundreds=89. 49+90=139, 139+89=228. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 228-98=130. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 0-99:40-49 \u219210 numbers. 100-199:140-149\u219210. 200-299:240-249\u219210. 300-399:340-349\u219210. 400-488:400-449\u219250 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+50=90. That seems right. For eights in the tens place: 0-99:80-89\u219210. 100-199:180-189\u219210. 200-299:280-289\u219210. 300-399:380-389\u219210. 400-488:480-488\u21929. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 228-98=130. Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me think about the hundreds place again. For fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For eights, there are no numbers in the hundreds place with 8, since the book ends at 488. So, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 130 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - From 0-399: 4 sets of 10 numbers each \u2192 40 occurrences.\n   - From 400-449: 50 occurrences.\n   - Total: 90 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 90 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 228.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 0-399: 4 sets of 10 numbers each \u2192 40 occurrences.\n   - From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 228 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 130.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{130}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, which ends with an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? Let's see: 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so after 484, the next 4 in the units place would be 494, but that's beyond 488. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449. The book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so all 5 blocks are complete. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me count: from 8 to 488, how many numbers ending with 8? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each full block before that contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 + 1 block * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. So, up to 380-389, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, zero occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8), and then an extra one for the 484. So, 48 times 1 plus 1 equals 49. So, 49 times 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in the page numbers. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in the page numbers. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in the 4's. For the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for the 4's. Let me check that again. Units place for 4: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times, correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488=8+10*(n-1). 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct. So, 49 each. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, all these blocks are valid. Therefore, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, so there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nSo, the first four blocks each have 10 eights, and the last block has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481 to 488 would be the 49th group, but since we're only going up to 488, the units place 4 occurs once more at 484. So, actually, it's 48 times from 1 to 480, plus one more at 484, making it 49 times. Wait, no. Because from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, there's 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, so 50 times. However, I should check if the upper limit is beyond 488. The last range is 440-449, which is fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 8 occurs 49 times because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. Now, check if there's a 480-489 range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the 480-489 range only goes up to 488. So, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but earlier I considered ranges as 80-89, etc., each with 10 numbers. However, in the case of 480-488, it's only 9 numbers. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is: for 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but actually, there's a fifth range, 480-488, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it as follows: For the tens digit, the number of times 8 appears is the number of complete hundreds times 10 plus any partial hundreds. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. For each hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each complete hundred. So, 0-99: 10 times, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Okay, so tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digits can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, let's see: - 0-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers. - 100-199: 140-149, another 10. - 200-299: 240-249, another 10. - 300-399: 340-349, another 10. - 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, adding these up: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 400-488, and 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 50 in total for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Now, for the tens place, each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, etc.), so 5*10=50. And units place, as calculated, is 49. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 has 10 such numbers. Let's see how many blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so in the 400-488 block, the tens place 8 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the count is 10 (from 0-99) + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the tens place for 8's again. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9, not 10. So, 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and one block of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, right? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, does that include the last page? Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 484 is within the 480-489 range, so 484 is included. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Let's calculate it as floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the total pages, so 488/10 = 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48, meaning 48 times. But wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 48 numbers because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, 4 is the first, 14 is the second, so 484 would be the 48th. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within that range, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Wait, let me check that addition: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10)=48. So, 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think: from 8,18,...,488. That's every 10 numbers starting at 8. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so the count would be 49. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is page 488, so yes, it's included. So, units place for 8: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but let me verify each step again. **Counting 4's:**\n\n- Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 +50 +89=187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for 8. Let me recount. From 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then 18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 8 is indeed 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as calculated, it's 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nAnd 4's:187.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, etc., up to 440-449. So, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nTotal 4's:187.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something, but going through each step again, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 484 is included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times that happens. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. For 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. For 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. For 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. For 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last block. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, when I counted units place, I got 49, and tens place 49, so 98 total 8's. But wait, let me double-check the tens place for 480-488. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, 482, etc., up to 488. So yes, 9 numbers. So, tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49. Units place: 49. So total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my counts again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct. For 8's in units place, similarly, 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. For tens place of 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each have 10, and the last has 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, yes, 8's hundreds place is 0. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each group, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, 48 complete groups would give 48 fours. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but the book only goes up to 488, so in the last incomplete group, how many fours are there in the units place? From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number in that range where the units digit is 4. So, that's one more 4. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, let's list these ranges: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. - 140-149: Another 10 fours. - 240-249: Another 10 fours. - 340-349: Another 10 fours. - 440-449: Another 10 fours. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all those are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. Now, check the last partial group: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so let's count these ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 180-189: Another 10 eights.\n- 280-289: Another 10 eights.\n- 380-389: Another 10 eights.\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the range is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in this range, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.
