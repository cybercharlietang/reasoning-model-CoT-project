    "text": " So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (second block), 240-249 (third block), 340-349 (fourth block), and 440-449 (fifth block). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (second), 280-289 (third), 380-389 (fourth). Wait, 480-489 would be the fifth block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, does that count as a full block? Let me think: 480-489 is a block of 10, but since we only go up to 488, the tens place 8 in 480-488 is present in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 which is 9 numbers. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and partially in 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the partial block contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 occurrences. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: Would there be a 480-489 block? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. However, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. Wait, but in the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, but in this case, the last block is incomplete. So, for the tens place, we have four complete blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4 * 10 = 40. Plus, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 400-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 complete blocks (each 10 numbers) and 9 numbers in the incomplete block, so total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: from 1-100, 10 fours; 101-200, another 10; 201-300, another 10; 301-400, another 10; and 401-488, which is only part of the 400s. Wait, but in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, except the last one which might be incomplete. Wait, no, in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so the 4 in the tens place occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, that's 9 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, but the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in each hundred block. Let's count how many complete hundred blocks there are. From 1-400, there are four complete hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but wait, 401-488 is part of the 400s. Wait, actually, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur in 400-488? Each hundred block (like 400-499) would have 10 fours in the tens place, but since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in 400-488? Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 10. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the range 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. That's 9 ranges, each with 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, the number of fours in the tens place from 400-488 is 8*10 + 9 = 89? Wait, that can't be right because each range is 10 numbers except the last. Wait, no, each range is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 9 times, each with 10 numbers except the last which has 9. Wait, no, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is the number of complete tens blocks. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is a block where the tens digit is 4. From 400-409: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. 410-419: another 10, etc. How many such blocks are there? From 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. That's 9 blocks. The first 8 blocks are complete (each has 10 numbers), and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, the number of fours in the tens place from 400-488 is 8*10 + 9 = 89? Wait, that can't be right because each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Wait, no, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, but the last block only has 9 numbers, so it contributes 9 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in the tens place from 400-488 is 8*10 + 9 = 89. Wait, but that seems high because 488 is only 488, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of fours in the tens place as follows: For each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundred blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? It occurs in 400-409, which is part of 401-488, but 400 is included? Wait, no, 401-488 starts at 401, so the first occurrence is 401-409, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 400 is page 400, which is included in the 400-488 range. Wait, maybe I should consider that from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, that's 13 blocks. Each of the first 12 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 12*10=120 fours. The last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So total fours in the tens place would be 120 + 9 = 129. But that seems too high because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Let me count the number of blocks: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 400-409 (5), 410-419 (6), 420-429 (7), 430-439 (8), 440-449 (9), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (11), 470-479 (12), 480-488 (13). So, 13 blocks. The first 12 blocks each contribute 10 fours, and the 13th block contributes 9 fours. So total fours in the tens place: 12*10 + 9 = 129. Wait, but 129 seems too high because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears 129 times? That doesn't seem right because each hundred has 10 occurrences, and 488 is less than 500, so maybe 4*10=40 up to 400, and then from 401-488, another 9 fours in the tens place. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the hundreds place with the tens place. Let me try a different approach. For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every 100 numbers, starting at the 40th position. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundred blocks are there? There are 4 complete hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 401-409 is part of 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (which is 10 numbers, but 400 is included, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 400 is included in the 400-488 range, so maybe it's better to consider that in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, each of these is a block where the tens digit is 4, and each contributes 10 fours except the last one, which contributes 9. So, from 400-488, how many such blocks are there? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. That's 9 blocks. Each of the first 8 blocks contributes 10 fours, and the last block contributes 9 fours. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 8*10 + 9 = 89 times. But wait, from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and then 400-488 as above. So, from 1-399, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, as calculated, 89 fours. Wait, that can't be right because 89 is way too high. I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again. The correct approach is to consider that in each hundred block, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundred blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 numbers, so 9 fours. Then, the next occurrence would be 410-419, which is 10 numbers, but 410 is included in 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. Similarly, 420-429: 10 fours, 430-439: 10 fours, 440-449: 10 fours, 450-459: 10 fours, 460-469: 10 fours, 470-479: 10 fours, and 480-488: 9 fours. Wait, but 401-488 is only up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, how many blocks are there in 401-488 where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 400-409 (but we start at 401, so 401-409: 9 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), 480-488 (9). That's 9 blocks. So, the number of fours in the tens place from 401-488 is 8*10 + 9 = 89. Wait, but that seems too high because 401-488 is only 88 numbers. How can the tens digit 4 occur 89 times? That's impossible because each occurrence is in a block of 10 numbers, and 88 numbers can't have 89 fours. I must be making a mistake in counting. Let me try a different method. For the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place from 1-488 can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. There are 4 complete hundred blocks up to 400, so 4*10=40.\n- Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 (but 401-409 is 9 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 1 (for 401-409) + 8 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. Wait, no, 401-409 is part of the 400-409 block, which is the first block where the tens digit is 4 in the 400s. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), ..., 480-488 (9). So, that's 9 blocks. Each of the first 8 blocks contributes 10 fours, and the last contributes 9. So, 8*10 + 9 = 89. But wait, from 400-488, that's 89 fours in the tens place, which seems too high. Let me check with a smaller number. Suppose we have a 100-page book. How many fours in the tens place? From 1-100, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 times. So, 10 fours. If I apply the same method: 1 hundred block, 10 fours. Correct. Now, if I have a 200-page book, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49 and 140-149, so 20 fours. So, 2 blocks, each contributing 10. So, 2*10=20. Correct. Now, for 488 pages, up to 400, it's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), ..., 480-488 (9). So, that's 9 blocks. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 9 blocks, but the first 8 are complete, each with 10 fours, and the last with 9. So, total from 400-488 is 8*10 + 9 = 89. Therefore, total fours in the tens place from 1-488 is 40 (from 1-400) + 89 (from 401-488) = 129. Wait, that can't be right because 129 is too high. I must be overcounting. Let me think differently. Maybe I should calculate the number of fours in the tens place as follows:\n\n- For each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to realize that for each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. For the tens place, the number of times digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = n // 100\ncurrent = (n // 10) % 10\nlower = n % 10\n\nif current > d: count = (higher + 1) * 10\nelif current == d: count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\nelse: count = higher * 10\n\nBut let me apply this formula for d=4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to use the formula correctly.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif remainder >= 10 * d + 10:\n    count += 10\nelif remainder >= 10 * d:\n    count += remainder - 10 * d + 1\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, let me test this with n=488 and d=4.\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nif current > d: count = (higher + 1) * 10\nBut current is 8, d is 4, so 8 > 4, so count = (4 + 1) * 10 = 50\n\nWait, but that seems off because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs more than 50 times. Wait, no, 50 seems too low because in each hundred block, it's 10 times, so 4 blocks would be 40, plus some more.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif remainder >= 10 * d + 10:\n    count += 10\nelif remainder >= 10 * d:\n    count += remainder - 10 * d + 1\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, let's test this with n=488, d=4.\n\ncount = (488 // 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40\nremainder = 488 % 100 = 88\nNow, 10*d = 40\nIs remainder >= 40 + 10? 88 >= 50? Yes.\nSo, count += 10\nTotal count = 40 + 10 = 50\n\nBut earlier, when I thought it was 129, that was clearly wrong. So, according to this formula, the number of fours in the tens place from 1-488 is 50. That seems more reasonable.\n\nWait, but let's test this formula with a smaller number. Let's take n=100, d=4.\n\ncount = (100 // 100) * 10 = 1 * 10 =10\nremainder = 100 % 100 = 0\nSince remainder < 40, we don't add anything. So, total is 10, which is correct because 40-49 are 10 numbers.\n\nAnother test: n=149, d=4.\n\ncount = (149 // 100) *10 =1*10=10\nremainder=149%100=49\nIs 49 >= 40 +10=50? No. So, check if remainder >=40. 49 >=40, yes. So, count +=49 -40 +1=10\nTotal count=10+10=20. Which is correct because 40-49 and 140-149 are two blocks, each contributing 10 fours.\n\nAnother test: n=488, d=4.\n\ncount=4*10=40\nremainder=88\n88 >=50? Yes, so add 10. Total 50.\n\nSo, the formula gives 50 fours in the tens place from 1-488.\n\nOkay, so I think I was overcomplicating earlier. The correct number of fours in the tens place is 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, let's sum up the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours=49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place:89 fours.\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nHmm, but when I think about the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many such numbers are there? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th. So, units place gives 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n\nUsing the same formula as before for the tens place with d=8 and n=488.\n\ncount = (488 // 100) *10=4*10=40\nremainder=488%100=88\nSince remainder >=80 (because 10*d=80), and since remainder=88 >=80, we add (88 -80 +1)=9\nSo, total eights in the tens place=40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the formula:\n\nFor d=8, n=488.\n\ncount = (488 // 100)*10=4*10=40\nremainder=488%100=88\nif remainder >=80 +10=90? 88 >=90? No. So, check if remainder >=80. 88 >=80, yes. So, count +=88 -80 +1=9\nTotal=40+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, number of eights in the hundreds place=0.\n\nNow, total eights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights=49+49=98.\n\nWait, that's 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which is 480-488, contributing 9 eights.\n\nSo, from 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in:\n\n80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\n\nTotal=10+10+10+10+9=49, which matches the formula result.\n\nSo, total eights=49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, total fours=188, total eights=98.\n\nDifference=188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, and the total fours were 188. But let me double-check the hundreds place for fours.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nTotal fours=49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, but when I first thought about the hundreds place for fours, I thought it was 89, which seems correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nBut let me think again: from 400-488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nUnits place: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nThe last number is 488, so 488//10=48, but since 488 is included, it's 48 full tens plus one more, so 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, using the formula, it's 50 fours.\n\nSo, total fours=49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Earlier, using the formula, I got 50 fours in the tens place, but when I thought about it manually, I thought it was 50, which seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with a smaller number. Let's say n=100, d=4.\n\nUsing the formula: count=(100//100)*10=1*10=10\nremainder=100%100=0\nSince remainder <40, count remains 10. Correct.\n\nn=149, d=4.\n\ncount=1*10=10\nremainder=49\nSince 49 >=40, count +=49-40+1=10\nTotal=20. Correct.\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\ncount=4*10=40\nremainder=88\nSince 88 >=40, count +=88-40+1=49\nWait, wait, no, the formula is:\n\nif remainder >=10*d +10:\n    count +=10\nelif remainder >=10*d:\n    count += remainder -10*d +1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nSo, for d=4, 10*d=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\n88 >=40+10=50? Yes, because 88 >=50.\n\nSo, count +=10.\n\nSo, total=40+10=50.\n\nWait, but 88-40+1=49, but since 88 >=50, we add 10 instead.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif remainder >= 10*d + 10:\n    count +=10\nelif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count += remainder -10*d +1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nSo, for n=488, d=4:\n\ncount=4*10=40\nremainder=88\n10*d=40\n10*d +10=50\nSince 88 >=50, count +=10\nTotal=50.\n\nSo, the formula gives 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nBut when I think about it manually, from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in:\n\n40-49:10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n400-409:10\n410-419:10\n420-429:10\n430-439:10\n440-449:10\n450-459:10\n460-469:10\n470-479:10\n480-488:9\n\nWait, that's 13 blocks, but according to the formula, it's 50 fours. Let's count how many fours that would be.\n\nFrom 40-49:10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n400-409:10\n410-419:10\n420-429:10\n430-439:10\n440-449:10\n450-459:10\n460-469:10\n470-479:10\n480-488:9\n\nThat's 12 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 12*10 +9=129 fours, which contradicts the formula's result of 50. So, I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the tens digit with the hundreds digit. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen considering the tens digit, each time the tens digit is 4,"

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, checking up to 488: 80-89 is within 488, 180-189 is within, 280-289 is within, 380-389 is within, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's. So, 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (40) = 89. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such ranges.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 89 = **99**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, the first four ranges each have 10, and the last one has 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The book has 488 pages, so the hundreds go up to 4. So, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds go up to 4. So, blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, there's no page number with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full sets of 100 we have. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count? Yes, because 488 is within the book. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book goes only up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets give 4 x 10 = 40, and the last set gives 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. Let's see, from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4. The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 10*(n-1) \u2264 484 => n-1 \u2264 48.4 => n \u2264 49.4. So, n=49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 8 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488. 10*(n-1) \u2264 480 => n-1 \u2264 48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 full sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete ranges we have. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let's calculate that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (from 480 to 488). Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total in tens place is 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers) 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers) 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers) 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers) 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights. How many full blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. However, the last block, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights, and the last block has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 6? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for 488, it's floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 fours in the units place. Similarly, for the tens place, the formula is floor((N + 1)/100) * 10 + something. Wait, maybe I should use a more systematic approach. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately. For units place: The number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 6? Hmm, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10 = 48.9, which truncates to 48. So, 48 fours in the units place. Similarly, for the tens place: The number of 4's in the tens place is determined by how many full groups of 100 there are, and then the remainder. Each full group contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 in each hundred. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 4 hundreds (0-3), that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That matches my earlier count. Now, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours. Wait, earlier I thought 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, but now it's 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Which one is correct? Let me recount. Units place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: As before, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, I think the correct count is 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th term because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 2? Wait, better to calculate: The number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of 4's, because it's every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor((488 + 1)/10) = 48.9, which truncates to 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10, but the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 full cycles (1-480) plus the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such full ranges are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 ranges. The first four are full, contributing 10 eights each, and the last one (480-488) contributes 9 eights (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial range, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours. However, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is the 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have up to 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place, I had 49. Tens place, 50. Hundreds place, 89. Total: 188. For eights: units place, 49. Tens place, 49. Hundreds place, 0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me check the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place, 49 times. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's check: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 eights because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89, correct. Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For the 8's: Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488), so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 isn't part of the book. So, how many sets of 100 are there where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.

Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers). So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the range 480-489 is only up to 488. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I think I might have missed something in the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, I think the calculation is right. Therefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but again, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count the ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total.

From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, 480 is the first, so 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so that's correct.

    "text": " So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many times this happens. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, let's see if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. And from 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but in terms of tens place, each block is 10 numbers. However, 480-489 would be a full block, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But for the tens place, each block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens digit. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. And 480-488: only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each full block gives 10 occurrences, and the last partial block gives 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The blocks are: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. For 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Units place for 4's: up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 times. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place up to 488 is 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit place separately. Let me try that. For 4's: units, tens, hundreds. Units: From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? That's every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, 484 is the last one, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. Tens: In the tens place, 4 can be in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: one block. 100-199: one. 200-299: one. 300-399: one. 400-488: does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: units place: same as before, 49 times. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40) and 9, totaling 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in every 10th number, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, how many such blocks are there? There are four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, actually, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks? Wait, no. Wait, 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149 is the second, 240-249 third, 340-349 fourth, and 440-449 fifth. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, same for each subsequent block. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). But wait, we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number (since 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers). So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, we have to check if 480-488 is included. So, let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, since the book goes up to 488, let's see how many complete blocks of 100 we have. The first block is 1-100, the second 101-200, the third 201-300, the fourth 301-400, and the fifth 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the fifth block is only up to 488. Now, in each complete block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, four blocks mean 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Now, in the incomplete fifth block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full occurrences, but since 488 is the 49th, we have 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each complete block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks we have. The first four blocks (1-400) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the fifth block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract 98 from 188, I get 90. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting, especially with the ranges. Let me verify the counts again. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 blocks (since 440-449 is within 488). So 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, earlier I thought the first four blocks (1-400) and then the fifth up to 488, but actually, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks, each contributing 10. So 5 * 10 = 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block contributes 10, except the last one which contributes 9. So 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9: 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So total eights: 49 +49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, but 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place. So from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So that's correct. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit position separately and see if I'm counting correctly. Alternatively, I can use a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a formula, but I'm not sure about the exact formula, so maybe it's better to stick with my initial method. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately for 4 and 8. So, for the units place, as I did, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. For the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. For the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Total eights: 49 +49 +0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So, that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 x 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's count: from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me think differently. The first occurrence is 8, which is the 8th number. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 488th page. How many numbers between 1 and 488 have 8 in the units place? It's the same as how many times 8 appears in the units place. The formula is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >= 8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which might be shorter. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the 8 appears in the tens place as follows: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 8's in the tens place might be 49, but let me double-check. Wait, in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. So, units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds is 0. So total 49+49=98. But wait, earlier when I thought about the units place, I thought it was 49, which seems correct. So, 8 appears 98 times. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me take a smaller example to verify. Suppose the book had 88 pages. How many 8's in units place? 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88. That's 9 times. Using the formula: floor(88/10)=8, plus 1 because 88 mod 10=8, so 8+1=9. Correct. Similarly, in the tens place: 80-88. That's 9 numbers. So, in units and tens, 9 each, total 18. Now, in our problem, up to 488. So, units place: 49, tens place:49, total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th term because 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5x10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I missed something in the 8's count. Let me think: in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so up to 488, it's floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488, so 48+1=49. Correct. In the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10. So, 488 is 48 * 10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place contributes 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Now, up to 488, how many such blocks are there? 1-99: 80-89. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: There's no 480-489 because 488 is the last page. So, only 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, that's (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, yes, 188 total 4's. For 8's, hundreds place is 0, so 89 total. So, the difference is 99. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. So, yes, that's correct. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. But wait, the last block is only up to 488, not 499. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred block. But since 488 is less than 499, the 400-488 block still has a full set of 40-49 in the tens place, right? Wait, no. 400-488 is a block where the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, but 449 is within 488, so that's a full set of 10 numbers. So, each of the five blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10 fours in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Wait, no, because in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is still within 488. So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. The last one is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's see how many full blocks we have. 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks with 10 eights each and one block with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would start at 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The hundreds digit is 4, so numbers from 400 to 488. The total numbers here are 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 0. So, units place contributes 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. However, since we're only considering the tens digit, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but the book stops at 488. So, how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. Therefore, the tens place 8's are: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, plus the partial range 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Therefore, tens place contributes 49 8's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. To find the number of occurrences, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but actually, since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the partial set from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, there's one block (40-49). In 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299 has 240-249, 300-399 has 340-349, and 400-488 has 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another block.

So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many times, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me think: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4). So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the pages from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me double-check. For the units place of 4's, I thought it was 49 times. But wait, when I go from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484. So, how many terms are there? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49. For tens place, 4's: 50 times, as we have 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. For 8's in tens place, 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Hundreds place: 4's have 89 (from 400-488), 8's have 0. So, 4's total 49+50+89=188, 8's total 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. 8's: 49 (units) +40 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =89. So, 188-89=99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488).\nTotal 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, the tens place gives 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 occurrences of 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48, but again, we have to check if 488 is included. From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so how many? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives 49 occurrences of 8. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which is from 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 0-99: 80-89 is 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place gives 49 occurrences of 8. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place gives 0 occurrences of 8. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 occurrences of 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because earlier, when I counted the units place for 4, I thought it was 49, and for 8 it was 49, but when I added up, I got 188 for 4 and 98 for 8. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4. Let me double-check that. The hundreds place for 4 is from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Now, for the tens place of 4: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those ranges has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, 50. That seems correct. Units place for 4: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, as 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8, units place is 8,18,...,488, which is 49. Tens place is 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me try a different approach. Instead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic way. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th group, the 4 is at 484, which is within 480-488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- For 8: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and the 49th group includes 488, so that's 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For 4: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range has 10 numbers. The number of such ranges is determined by how many hundreds are there. From 0-99: 1 range (40-49). From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- For 8: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9, since 488 is the end). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\n- For 8: The hundreds digit is 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 48 \u00d7 10 + 8. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and then the 49th is 488. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8 as the first, then 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each block: 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens place 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial block. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. Let's count each block: - 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 the 49th. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, each block except the last contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, 4 blocks with 10 and 1 block with 9: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 numbers. However, wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, for each hundred, the 40-49 range contributes 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the 400-488 range isn't a full hundred; it's only up to 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 3 sets \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place fours: 30 + 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, so yes, 40 total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place gives 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many full sets we have. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds? 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, each of the first four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 400-488: does it include 480-489? Yes, up to 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 3 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u00d710 = 30, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 30 + 9 = 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place gives 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 - 88 = 90. Wait, let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. Total 178. For 8's: units 49, tens 39, hundreds 0. Total 88. 178 - 88 is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. That's 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 489 is beyond 488, so the last number is 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? First four blocks (0-399) have 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, 481, 482,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So, tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Wait, earlier I thought there were 4 blocks before 400, each with 10, so 40, and then 9 in 480-488. So total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 =98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is correct. So, 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 before 400, and 9 after. So, 40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: For the 4's in the hundreds place, it's 89, which is correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

So, from 0-99: 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total blocks with tens digit 4 are 5, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50.

The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks do we have? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), not 10. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 from 400-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. Let me count how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counting, especially for the hundreds place in fours and eights. For fours in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For eights in the hundreds place: none, correct. For the tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484: 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488 is 48*10 +8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place gives me 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these: - 40-49: 10 numbers (40 to 49 inclusive)\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, so it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18,..., 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 occurrences, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Wait, let me check: starting from 8, each step of 10 adds one. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers), 180-189 is another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another. That's 4 sets. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more eights. So, total in tens place is 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, units place has 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many complete blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49, that's the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it counts. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's subtract 399 from 488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, and 380-389: another 10. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 8's. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be another block, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of this block. But since we're only counting up to 488, the tens digit from 480-488 is 8 for 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, but earlier I thought of blocks as 80-89, etc., which are complete. So, 480-489 would be another block, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens place 8's from 480-488 are 9 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The blocks for the tens place 8's are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place (since 488 is the last page). So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 8's, which included 488. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 (from first four blocks) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
