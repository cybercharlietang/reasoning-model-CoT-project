    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, units place: 49 times? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as for each set of ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In 481-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 484. So that's one more, making it 49 times. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: the last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc. Let's count how many such blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's 9 more. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is beyond 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4, so maybe it's 49 times. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number in the units place is 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, and the last number with 4 in the units place before that is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. For the units place, the number of 4's from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such tens are there? From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490. So, actually, there are 48 full decades (each contributing one 4 in the units place) and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In these 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 48 +1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last decade is 481-490, but the book only goes up to 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the 481-490 decade, only up to 488 is printed, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the units place in this partial decade, which is at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from full decades) +1 (from the partial decade) = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place 4's: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, but let's go through it again. The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each of these is 8 more than a multiple of 10. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8 (which is 1*8), the last term is 488 (which is 48*10 +8). So, the number of terms is 48 +1 = 49. Wait, because starting from 8 (which is 0*10 +8), up to 488 (which is 48*10 +8). So, that's 49 terms. So, units place 8's: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, let's count how many full ranges we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place 8's: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and a partial decade contributing 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. That's 48 full decades (each contributing one 4) plus one more in the 481-488 range, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full decades (10 each) and one partial decade with 9 numbers, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is correct because 488 is the last page.\n\nI think I've considered all cases. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups plus one more in the partial group).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups plus one more in the partial group).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 divided by 10) which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, the 484 is within the 480-488 range, so that's the 49th 4 in the units place. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48. But wait, in the 480-488 block, the units place 4 appears at 484, which is within this block, so that's one more, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I should confirm this. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each 10 numbers, one 4. So from 1 to 488, that's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 481-488. So, in each of the 48 full decades, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this, so that's one more 4, making it 49 in the units place. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's included in the 48th decade. Wait, no: 488 is the 49th decade? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms in this sequence is given by ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1. That's (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Now, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's incomplete. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 8's, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, the last number 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is part of the 480-489 range, which is the 49th set (since 480 is the 49th multiple of 10). So, 488 is included, so units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one with 9. So total 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (48 full sets of 10 and one additional in 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 4 full ranges (10 each) + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each group has exactly one 4 in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 10 to 480) plus the 4 in 484, which is the 48th group. Wait, no, 480 is the 48th group, so 480-489 would be the 48th group, but our book ends at 488, so the 48th group is 480-488. So, in the units place, each group of 10 contributes one 4, so 48 groups would give 48 4's. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups and a partial group. Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this group, contributing one more 4. So total 48 +1=49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, right? So, in that group, only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So yes, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50 4's. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Plus, in the partial group 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but only the tens digit is 8, so each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, for the tens place, we have: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** \n     - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (1-480) and a partial group (481-488).\n     - Each full group contributes 1 '4', totaling 48.\n     - The partial group includes 484, adding 1 more.\n     - **Total in Units Place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Each range contributes 10 '4's.\n     - There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - **Total in Tens Place:** 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n     - Numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - **Total in Hundreds Place:** 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Similar to '4', '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Total groups: 48 full groups and a partial group (481-488) with 488 included.\n     - **Total in Units Place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 '8's.\n     - The range 480-488 contributes 9 '8's (480-488).\n     - **Total in Tens Place:** 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n     - **Total in Hundreds Place:** 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since each 10 numbers contribute one 4, the total number is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(48.8) is 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually 49 because 484 is included. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then from 480 to 488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. The highest range would be 440-449. Now, since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me confirm. From 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit is 4. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. However, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but the problem is that the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The total number is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Alternatively, since 488 is the last page, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges are fully included and partially included. - 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: this is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four ranges contribute 4 * 10 = 40 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me confirm: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're including both endpoints, maybe it's 49. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So total in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each range: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th? Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10, which is 40, plus 9, so 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Four ranges of 10 and one range of 9: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 divided by 10) which is 48.8, but since we're only considering up to 484 for the units place, perhaps it's 48 times plus one more, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= d. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. For the units place, every 10 numbers contribute exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but our book only goes up to 488, so in the last group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is the 48th occurrence plus one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9 (from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers). So, how many full blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial block 480-488 contributes 9 (480,481,...,488, but only 480-488, which is 9 numbers). So, total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges, but the first four are full (10 each) and the last one is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49, which matches my earlier count. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my counts again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me see if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these 5 blocks contributes 10, so 50. That's correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 times. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49 (8,18,...,488). Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 \u00f7 10) which is 48.8, and take the floor of that plus 1 if the last number is included. Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is floor((n + 1) / 10) where n is 488. So, (488 + 1)/10 = 489/10 = 48.9, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times? Wait, but 4,14,...,484 would be 49 times because starting from 4, every 10 numbers. Let me list a few: 4 (1),14(2),24(3),...,484 (49th). So 484 is the 49th occurrence. So maybe the count is 49. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. For each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's an additional 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 numbers. So how many sets is that? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in each hundred. So from 0-488, how many hundreds? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So how many such numbers? Let's see, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. The number of terms is given by floor((488 + 1)/10) = 489/10 = 48.9 \u2192 48. But wait, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8 in the tens place. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these sets (except the last one) has 10 numbers. Let's count how many full sets we have: 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 180-189 is another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89 \u2192 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0 \u2192 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds digit for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each hundred, except the last set which has 9 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds digit as the book only goes up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers), giving 48 fours, and then in the 49th group, which is 480-488, the units digit is 4 at 484. So, that's 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 480-488, so yes, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place: 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.

How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, first four ranges: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last range: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, which is correct. So, total eights: 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. The ranges are 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, we're only counting the hundreds digit, so each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but that seems high. Wait, no, actually, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let's add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is included, so 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me verify the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. That seems correct. For 8's, the hundreds place doesn't occur because the book doesn't reach 800. So, yes, 0. The tens place for 8's: up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. Units place: same as 4's, 49 times. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, since 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, which is 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For numbers from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one group, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another group, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count the groups: From 0-99: 80-89 is one group, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four groups each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, and the last group contributes 9 8's. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 480,481,...,488. The tens digit is 8 for all these, which is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times (no page numbers from 800-899).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that would be the 49th time. So, actually, it's 49 times in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 4 in the 49th group (484). So, that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. In that group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, making it 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically in the 40-49 range, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, but since we're only looking at the tens place, it doesn't affect the count beyond 449. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding up the occurrences: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 +1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 occurrences, not 10. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, adding up the occurrences: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly, especially in the tens place for 4's and 8's. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. For 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's in the hundreds place: none. Correct. Units place: 4's and 8's both have 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me think again: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Since we're going up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: does 480-489 exist? But since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but when considering the tens place, in the hundreds block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let me correct this: in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, that would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th term. Wait, because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? Let me calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. So, how many ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial range 480-488 contributing 9. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as for each hundred, there are 10 numbers with a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds plus 88 pages. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers with a 4 in the units place. So, 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many 4's are in the units place? From 401 to 488, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, the 4's in the units place would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 more 4's. So, total in units place is 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the book. So, the ranges are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). But in the tens place, each range is 10 numbers, so 480-489 would be a full range, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full ranges do we have? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) give 4*10=40, plus 9, totaling 49. That seems right. So, yes, 98 8's. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, let me think again. The formula for counting digits in a specific place is to take the higher digits, then the current digit, then the lower digits. For units place: For numbers up to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is calculated as follows. The number of complete groups of 10 is 488 // 10 = 48. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 (from the groups) + 1 (from 488) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 488 is beyond 389, so 380-389 is fully included. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units: 49, tens: 40, hundreds: 0. 49+40=89. So, 187-89=98. Hmm, so the answer should be 98 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, which is correct? Let me see: 4,14,...,484. The first term is 4, last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. So, units place for 4's is 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49 as well because 488 is included. So, correcting that, 4's units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. Total 8's:89. So, 188-89=99. Wait, now I'm getting 99. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me recast the problem. For any digit position, the count can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by:\n\n- Split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n- If the current digit is greater than d, add (higher +1) * 10^lower_digits.\n- If the current digit is equal to d, add higher * 10^lower_digits + (lower +1).\n- If the current digit is less than d, add higher * 10^lower_digits.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try again for 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\nNumbers from 1 to 488. How many numbers end with 4? They are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but 48*10=480, so 484 is 480 +4, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place:\nNumbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, and how many blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\nNumbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488//10=48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488 itself is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many blocks? 4 blocks, so 4*10=40.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\nNo numbers from 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+40+0=89.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-89=99.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 98, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 49 instead of 48, leading to 188-89=99.\n\nBut let me check again. When counting units place for 4's, is it 49 or 48? Let's list them:\n\n4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,484.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,28,...,488. That's also 49 numbers.\n\nSo, 4's total:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's total:49 (units)+40 (tens)+0=89.\n\nDifference:188-89=99.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 98, but now it's 99. Which is correct? Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 99. But wait, in the initial problem statement, the book has 488 pages, so page numbers go up to 488. So, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+40=89.\n\nDifference:188-89=99.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought 4's in units place was 48, but now it's 49. So, the initial mistake was in the units place for 4's. So, the correct answer should be 99.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let's take a smaller example to verify the method.\n\nSuppose we have a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place:4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place:40-49, but since we only go up to 20, no 4's in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18 \u21922 times.\n\nTens place: none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:2-2=0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:20//10=2, so 2.\n\nTens: floor(20/100)=0, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:20//10=2, so 2.\n\nTens:0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:5 (4,14,24,34,44).\n\nTens:50//100=0, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:5 (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nTens:0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-50, 4's and 8's in units place are both 5, so difference is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 54 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:5 (4,14,24,34,44).\n\nTens:50-59: but 54 is less than 59, so only 50-54. So, tens digit 5, but we're looking for 4. So, tens place 4's are in 40-49, which is fully included in 54. So, 10 numbers, but wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, but 54 is beyond 49, so 40-49 is fully included. So, tens place 4's:10.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5 (units) +10 (tens)=15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:5 (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nTens:40-49: tens digit 4, but we're looking for 8 in tens place. So, 80-89, but 54 is less than 80, so no 8's in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, let me count manually:\n\nNumbers from 1-54.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925.\n\nTens:40-49 \u219210.\n\nTotal:15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925.\n\nTens: none.\n\nTotal:5.\n\nDifference:10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for this case.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the difference should be 99.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 188-89=99, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+40 (tens)=89.\n\nDifference:188-89=99.\n\nSo, the answer is 99.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 4's in units place was 48, but after checking, it's 49. So, the initial mistake was in the units place for 4's, which corrected from 48 to 49, leading to a total of 188 4's instead of 187, and thus the difference increased by 1, making it 99 instead of 98.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (since 484 is included).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 40.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = 89.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48. But since 488 is included, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, perhaps the correct count is 49 times in the units place. Let me verify that. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But since 484 is within the range, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book ends at 488, 449 is within the range. So, each of these five ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, plus the last number 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 4 x 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's. Units place: 8,18,...,488. Same as above: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. 4x10=40, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So, 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. When I was counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But in each of those, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, 9 is correct. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to include or exclude a number. Let me try another approach: using the formula for digit counting. For each digit position, calculate how many times a digit appears. Let's start with 4's. Units place: For each complete group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48. But then, we have 488, which is the 49th number, but in the units place, it's 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, 48 + 1=49. Correct. Tens place: For each complete group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete groups of 100 are in 488? 4. So, 4 x 10 =40. Then, in the last partial group (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now for 8's. Units place: Similar to 4's, each group of 10 has one 8. 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49. Tens place: Each group of 100 has a range where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete groups of 100 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399). Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4x10=40. Then, in the last group, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Hundreds place: As before, no numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, contributing 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to '4', there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete ranges contributing 40 occurrences, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488 is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are, plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the 48th group end at 480, so the 48th group would have 480, which is 480, so the units digit is 0. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again. For each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such groups are there up to 488? The total number of groups is 488 // 10, which is 48 full groups (since 48*10=480). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So, total 48 +1=49 times 4 appears in the units place. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range, but 450-488 would have tens digits from 5 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 140-149: another 10 times.\n- 240-249: another 10 times.\n- 340-349: another 10 times.\n- 440-449: another 10 times.\n\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488, so from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, every 10 numbers, so from 8,18,28,... up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total units place:48+1=49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers.\n- 180-189:10.\n- 280-289:10.\n- 380-389:10.\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, total tens place:4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, tens place:49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place:0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, which is correct. So, total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place:49, as we have 48 full groups and one more at 488.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188-98=90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, when I counted the hundreds place for 4, I said from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nUnits place:49 times.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in ranges, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me verify the counts again.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in units, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in units, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more at 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 48 full groups, contributing 48, plus one at 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 488 pages.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 49th number. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, in the 440-449 block, the hundreds digit is 4, but we're only considering the tens place here. So, yes, each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. So, 4*10 = 40 times. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still valid. So, that's another block: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, does that count as a full block? Well, in terms of tens place, 480-489 would be a block where the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that count as a full block? Hmm, maybe not. So, perhaps only 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, and then an additional 9 numbers in 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is the hundreds place. So, when we're considering the tens place, 480-488 is another block where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit 8, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks. 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds digit never is 8, so that's 0.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, in the units place, there are 49 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a 40-49 block. So, how many hundreds are there? From 100 to 400, that's four blocks: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's only 88 pages. But the tens place can still have 40-49 in 400-488. So, for each full hundred, there's 10 occurrences, and in the last partial hundred (400-488), we have 10 occurrences as well because 400-409 is part of it, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-409, which is 10 numbers (400-409), but 409 is the 10th. Wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 400-488 is up to 488, so 400-409 is included, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) each contributing 10 numbers. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, 178 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 is included. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many full blocks there are. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of these, the 80-89 block contributes 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). Similarly, 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Now, in 400-488, does 480-489 exist? But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of it. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 400-488 contributes only 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 3 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 3*10=30, plus the 400-488 block contributing 9. So, 30 + 9 = 39 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88. So, 88 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 88 from 178: 178 - 88 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units place: 49, tens: 40, hundreds:89. Total 178. For 8's: units:49, tens:39, hundreds:0. Total 88. Difference: 178 -88=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I thought each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, but from 100-199, 40-49 is 10 numbers, but wait, 40-49 is in 100-199? No, wait, 40-49 is in 1-99. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered blocks like 40-49 in each hundred, but actually, in the hundreds, the tens place 4's would be in 400-409, 440-449, etc. Wait, no, wait, no, I think I confused something. Let me correct this. When counting the tens place for 4's, it's not about the hundreds block, but the tens digit. So, for example, in 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and also 400-409 would have 4 in the tens place? Wait, no, 400-409 has 0 in the tens place, right? Wait, no, 400 is 4 0 0, so the tens digit is 0. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0. So, in 400-488, where does the tens digit become 4? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, the 4's occur in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but that was incorrect. Wait, no, wait: 1-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, the tens place for 4's is 50, not 40 as I previously thought. That changes things. So, correcting the 4's count: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of 4's. Now, for 8's, let's check if I made a similar mistake. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each is 10 numbers, so 4 sets, each 10, so 40. But wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) and 9 from 400-488, so 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 3 sets of 10 and 9, totaling 39. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify: In 1-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) and 9 in 400-488. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. So, earlier I thought it was 39, but it's actually 49. Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is the fifth block, but in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the total tens place 8's are 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, and 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49, tens 39, total 88. So, I think I made a mistake in the tens place count for 8's. Let me correct that. So, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 98 occurrences of 8's. Now, the difference between 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought 178-88=90, but after correcting, it's 188-98=90. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me double-check the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought it was 50, but let me recount. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, 50 in tens, 49 in units, and 89 in hundreds, total 50+49=99; 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89, correct. So, 89 in hundreds, 50 in tens, 49 in units, total 188. For 8's: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (1st digit):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. Let me think. For each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. How high does this go? The last page is 488, so the last range with a 4 in the tens place would be 440-449. After that, the next would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many ranges are there? From 0-400, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let's add them up: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, breaking it down into units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 is present once more (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, when counting the 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as contributing 9 8's. But let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's correct. So, 4 ranges \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, which is 48 times, plus the 8 in 488, making it 49. So, yes, 49 units and 49 tens, totaling 98. So, the difference is indeed 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Up to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 4's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, except the last range (440-449) which is fully within 488. Thus, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times. The number 488 adds one more, making it 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). This gives 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me verify: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490. So, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but actually, the 48th occurrence would be at 480, and then 484 is the next one, which would be the 49th. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,...,484. Let's compute how many times that is. The first number is 4, the last is 484. The difference is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48 intervals, so 49 numbers in total. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so the last block is 440-449. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The first occurrence is at 8, the last at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so the last block is 380-389. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. So, that's 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units place (49) + tens place (40) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I got 49, which seems correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. For the tens place, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50, which seems right. Hundreds place: 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's: units place, from 8 to 488, that's 49 times. Tens place: 4 blocks, each 10, so 40. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nSo, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 -89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since 800-899 exceeds 488).\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **99**.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Let me confirm: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we start counting from 0, it's 48 full cycles plus one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Therefore, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49, that's one block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so does the last block 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 blocks are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we can't have a fraction. So, 48 full cycles, which would end at 480, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are and the partial one. The first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 8's. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers are there here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 8's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me confirm: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're starting from 4, which is the 1st, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on, up to 484 as the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is within the book. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, starting from 8, which is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-489 is a full range, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. Normally, each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. But in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, and the last partial range contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Hmm, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. Tens place for 4's: ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. That seems correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th. Wait, but 484 is 4 in the units place, so yes, 49. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So 188 is correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49. Wait, in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 which is 9, so total 49. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me try another approach. Maybe instead of counting each digit, I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let's go through each position one by one.\n\n**Units place:**\n- For any digit d (0-9), the number of times it appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as:\n  - If N >= d, then floor((N - d)/10) + 1\n  - But wait, actually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) if d=0, else floor((N + 1)/10). Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as for each complete group of 10, the digit appears once, and then check the remainder.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n- For 4: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many? Let's see, 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's 49 numbers (since starting from 0, 4 is the 1st, 14 the 2nd, etc., up to 484 as the 49th).\n\nSimilarly, for 8: 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so that's 49 numbers as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's units place was 49 and 8's was 49. So, that's consistent.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- For 4: The tens digit is 4 in ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if N is less than 449. But since N=488, 440-449 is fully included. So, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50.\n\nFor 8: The tens digit is 8 in ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But since N=488, the last range is only up to 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) with 10 each, and 1 partial with 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n- For 8: The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89 \u2192 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0 \u2192 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake, but after checking again, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let's see: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages: 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). We want the last term \u2264488. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But wait, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit for the tens place being 4 can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does the last block go up to 488? The block 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are complete. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is at 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 pages. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 +10(n-1). Setting this \u2264488: 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But wait, 480-489 would be pages 480-488, since 489 is beyond 488. So, for the tens place being 8, the blocks are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block has only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place except the last one, which contributes 9. So, let's calculate: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. The block 480-488 is pages 480 to 488, which is 9 pages, but each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's. So, 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9, total 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Similarly, we'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many ranges that is. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last). So, how many total? 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4x10=40, plus the last partial range 480-488 which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers, including 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (ranges 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers, including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (ranges 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last being 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, in 488 numbers, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers. In each full decade, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But then, in the last partial decade, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one, 140-149 is two, 240-249 is three, 340-349 is four, and 440-449 is five. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count how many. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers. In each full decade, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Now, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is a partial block. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many 8's in the tens place? 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: from 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. Wait, no, because the first one is 4, which is the 4th number. So, actually, it's every 10 numbers starting from 4. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 488 is the last number, and 488 is 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me calculate it as follows: For each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 48 full sets (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit into 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, but let's check. The 8 in the units place occurs every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10)=48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: from 8, 18, ..., 488. Each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 48 full sets (480 numbers), and then 8 more (481-488). So, in the full sets, 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many such ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me check again. Units place for 4: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? The last one is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, so earlier I thought units place 4's were 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which is correct? Let me see: From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The units place 4's should be 49, not 48. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, I had 49, which would be correct because 488 is included. So, let me correct that. So, for 4's: Units place:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, so now I get 90. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place for 4's. Let me clarify: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times the units digit is 4. That happens at 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is the number of times 4 appears in the units place. The first is 4, the last is 484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, so the number of steps is 480/10=48, but since we include both endpoints, it's 48+1=49. So, units place 4's:49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place:8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's:49. So, earlier, I had 48 for 4's, which was wrong. It's actually 49. So, correcting that, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so earlier I thought 187-98=89, but after correcting units place for 4's, it's 188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Checking the tens place for 4's: ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 50 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's:400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's: tens place ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, the last has 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for 8's:49. Correct. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers in the 800s.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and a partial set from 481 to 488. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Now, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 count fully? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 is correct. Units and tens seem correct as well. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but for 8's. So, numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. **For 4's:**\n- Units place: 49 (correct, since 488//10=48, plus 1 for 484)\n- Tens place: 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contributing 10, so 50\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**For 8's:**\n- Units place: 49 (same as 4's)\n- Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think about the tens place for 8's again. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But in the last set, 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such sets, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full sets contributing 40 occurrences, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so from 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, we need to check if 480-488 is included. Let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. From 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full sets and one partial set. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last page. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49 because from 1 to 488, the 4's in the units place occur at 4,14,24,...,484. Let me count: 4 is the first, then every 10 pages. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 more. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Then, 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can also have a 4. This happens from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many pages are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 8's instead of 10 because we stop at 488. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for 4's. When I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50. Correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct. For the units place, 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, so 49 4's. Correct. For 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. 49 numbers, so 49 8's. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so total 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I was wrong before. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484. So, that's 49 times because 480 is the 48th group, and 484 is within that group. Hmm, maybe I should use a different approach. The number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the floor, then adding 1 if the units digit of the total is 8 or more. Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Let me think: For each page number, the units digit cycles every 10. So, in 488 pages, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490). So, up to page 488, there are 48 full decades (each contributing one 4 in the units place) and then 8 more pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is the first block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, the last at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers), 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the block 480-489 is only up to 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 as well, but only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but when counting the tens digit, each block is 10 numbers. So, 480-489 would be another block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. But when counting the tens digit, each block is 10 numbers, so 480-489 would be a full block, but since we stop at 488, it's incomplete. So, how many full blocks of 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the difference would be smaller. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The blocks where the tens digit is 8 are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times the tens digit 8. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 98 total 8's. For 4's: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like the difference should be 90, but maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as 400-488 inclusive, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 < 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct. Units place for 4's: 49. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the units place. For 4's in units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, starting at 4, each step of 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. For 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. Similarly, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. So, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

    "text": " Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only counting up to 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4, so 48 full groups of 10 and then the 4 in the next group. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: that's the second. 240-249: third. 340-349: fourth. 440-449: fifth. Now, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which gives 48*10=480, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count these blocks. 80-89: that's one block, contributing 10 numbers. 180-189: second block, 10 numbers. 280-289: third block, 10 numbers. 380-389: fourth block, 10 numbers. 480-488: that's only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated as the total number of pages divided by 10, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to adjust. So, for units place, the number of 4's is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 484 is within 488, that's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, maybe it's 48 times. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. In each cycle of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete cycles of 10 in 488, which is 488 // 10 = 48. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last cycle is incomplete, but it still includes a 4 at 484, which is within the 488 pages. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for the tens place, the 4 can appear in the tens place in each hundred block. So, for each hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 hundreds. But wait, the last one, 400-488, is only up to 488, so does that affect the count? In the tens place, 400-488 includes 400-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (tens 1), ..., 480-488 (tens 8). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 48+50=98, 98+89=187? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 4's. Tens place: 50 4's. Hundreds place: 89 4's. So, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, let's see: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, which is 8 = 0*10 +8, the last is 488=48*10 +8. So, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:98. The difference is 187 -98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, in the last group, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place.

This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449. That's five ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. The last range would be 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four ranges, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. The last range is 480-488, which contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4 (in 400-488). So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete ranges (each 10 numbers) and the last partial range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number by 10 and taking the floor, then adding 1 if the digit is present in the remaining part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, we check the remaining 8 pages (481-488). In this range, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then maybe 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 complete blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 401-500, but we only go up to 488. In this block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449 and then 450-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more. So total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so in the last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last block which contributes 9. How many complete blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check my calculations again. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as contributing 10 4's in the tens place, but actually, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, which is correct. Then, in the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is the fifth block. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50. That's correct. So, 4's in tens place:50. Then, units place:49, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49. Let me check tens place again. Each block of 100 has 10 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 40+9=49. Units place:49. So, total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449 in the 400-488 range).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - In the last block (401-488), 8 appears from 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers starting at 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The total count would be the number of times 4 appears in the units place. Let me calculate it as follows: The first number is 4, which is the 4th number. Then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 488 is the last page, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence? Wait, no, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1)/10). Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, for each 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is incomplete. However, in the units place, the 4 would still appear once in that incomplete set (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is the last page, and 488 mod 10 is 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, let me check with a smaller number. For example, from 1 to 14, how many 4's in the units place? 4 and 14, so two times. 14/10 is 1.4, floor is 1, but actually, it's two times. So, maybe the formula is floor((N + 1)/10). Let's test that: For N=14, (14 + 1)/10 = 1.5, floor is 1, which is still incorrect. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as for every 10 numbers, starting from 0, the units digit cycles. So, from 0 to 487, there are 488 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full times, and then check if the remaining 8 numbers (488 - 48*10 = 8) include a 4 in the units place. The remaining numbers are 480 to 487. The units digits go from 0 to 7, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, total units place 4's: 48 times.\n\nWait, but from 1 to 488, the first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the 4th number, and the last is at 484, which is the 484th number. So, the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so it's 49 times. Because it's inclusive, so the formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, in this case, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but now with this formula, it's 49. Let me verify with a smaller number. From 1 to 14, how many 4's in the units place? 4 and 14, so two times. Using the formula: last=14, first=4. (14-4)/10 +1 = 10/10 +1=1+1=2. Correct. So, the formula works. So, applying that to 488, the last 4 in units place is 484, first is 4. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, and each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: one block.\n\nFrom 100-199: one block.\n\nFrom 200-299: one block.\n\nFrom 300-399: one block.\n\nFrom 400-488: one block.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5*10=50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the last block: 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\nThen 140-149:10.\n\n240-249:10.\n\n340-349:10.\n\n440-449:10.\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's in the tens place is 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). In each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nUsing the same method as before: first occurrence at 8, last at 488.\n\nNumber of occurrences: (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 times.\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller number. From 1 to 18: 8 and 18, so two times. Using the formula: (18-8)/10 +1=10/10 +1=1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSo, for 488, it's 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in blocks like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nSo, let's count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\n- 180-189:10.\n\n- 280-289:10.\n\n- 380-389:10.\n\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers).\n\nSo, total occurrences in tens place: 4 blocks of 10, and 1 block of 9.\n\nSo, 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9.\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4 again. I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. The blocks are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, let me think again. For units digit 4, the count from 1 to 488 is how many times 4 appears in the units place. Each block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. That's 48 fours. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is in this range, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one range, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last range: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8, which occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many complete ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 (in 400-488) and lower. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait a second: in the tens place, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the tens place. The ranges where the tens digit is 8 are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49+49=98, but let me confirm. Yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "num_tokens": 4420,
    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times for 1-480, and then 484 is the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 within that hundred, but wait, 401-488 is actually from 401 to 488, so the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, etc., up to 8 in 481-490. Wait, but 488 is the end, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but the 401-488 range doesn't include 440-449 because 440 is beyond 488? Wait no, 440 is less than 488. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 x 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because in the 400-499 range, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 450-499 is beyond 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 x 10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 400 is included in the 401-488 range? No, 400 is the start of the next hundred. Wait, no, 400 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, the 400-488 range includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks of 10 numbers each. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is the fifth block. So, from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 5 blocks of 10, so 5 x 10 = 50. That makes sense. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the units digit 4 occurs in 4,14,...,484. How many terms are there? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. Let's solve 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 484 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u2192 n \u2264 49.4, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. That's correct.\n\nTens place: as above, 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: from 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. The first four are complete (each 10 numbers), and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, which it is. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's were 188 and 8's 98, so 90 more 4's. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49 numbers, as above.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nTens place for 4's: numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nYes, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484, with a common difference of 10.\n   - Using the formula for the nth term: 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484 \u2192 n = 49.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488, with a common difference of 10.\n   - Using the formula for the nth term: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 n = 49.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers.\n   - The fifth block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
