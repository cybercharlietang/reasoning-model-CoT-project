So, for units digit 4, it's (488 + 1) /10 = 489/10=48.9, so 48 full times, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I should think differently. For units digit, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488. So, in each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, in the 48th block, which is 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so does the 48th block have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within 480-488, so that's the 48th occurrence. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place before that. So, that would be 48 fours. But earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The first 4 in units place is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, 4,14,24,...,484. Now, how many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6, where n starts at 1. So, 10n -6 =484 => 10n=490 =>n=49. So, there are 49 terms. So, units place has 49 fours. So, my initial count was correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:188.

That seems right. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189(10), 280-289(10), 380-389(10), 480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours there. So, 188 seems correct. And 98 eights. So, 90 more fours. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, it's 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. That seems right. Similarly, for 8's, the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 49 in total. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like 90 is a big number, but maybe it's correct. Let me think of another way to count. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, as I did, but perhaps I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89. Correct. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189(10), 280-289(10), 380-389(10), 480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) =48 full tens, but wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, does that add an extra? Wait, no, because 488 is an 8 in units, not a 4. So, maybe I overcounted earlier. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for units digit 4, how many times does it occur up to 488? It's the same as how many complete sets of 10 there are, and then any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the first 4 is at 4, which is the 4th number in the first set (1-10). So, in each set of 10, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 full sets would give 48 fours, but since 488 is the last page, which is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is 48*10 +4. So, 48 fours in units place. Similarly, in tens place: each 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place, so from 40-49, etc. How many hundreds are there? Up to 488, which is 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, 488 is less than 500). So, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in tens place. Now, hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187. Wait, earlier I thought 49 in units, but now I'm getting 48. Which is correct? Let me check: the units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6, where n=1 gives 4, n=2 gives14, etc. Let me see when 10n -6 =484. 10n=490, so n=49. So, there are 49 terms. So, units place has 49 fours. So, my initial count was correct. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: total 188 fours. Now, for the eights: units place is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 10n -2. When does 10n -2 =488? 10n=490, so n=49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Because for units place, the number of times a digit appears is floor((n + 9 - d)/10), where d is the digit. Wait, maybe a better way is to consider that in each block of 10, the digit appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in units place, but the 49th block (480-489) has 484, so that's 484 is the 49th occurrence. So units:49. Tens place: as before, 10 per hundred, and we have 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours. So, from 0-99:40-49, which is 10. Then 100-199:140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299:240-249, 300-399:340-349, and 400-488:440-449, which is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Then hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is included. So, how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. So the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So, that's fine. Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe another way: for each hundred, the units digit cycles 10 times, so in 1-100, 4 appears 10 times in units place, then in 101-200, another 10, etc. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so maybe it's better to think in hundreds. Let me try this approach. For units place in 4's: Each hundred has 10 fours in the units place. There are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). But wait, 401-500 is only up to 488, so that's 88 numbers. So, in each hundred except the last, there are 10 fours in the units place. So, 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40, but the last hundred (401-488) has how many fours in units place? From 401 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, so how many complete cycles are there? 488 -400 =88, so 88 numbers. 88 /10 =8.8, so 8 complete cycles, which would give 8*10=80 fours, but wait, that can't be right because from 401 to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484. That's 9 times, because 404 is the first, then every 10, up to 484. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times. So, units place in the last hundred (401-488) has 9 fours. So, total units fours: 4 hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 401-488, total 49. That matches my earlier count. So, units place:49 fours. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.). How many hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400,401-500). Wait, but 401-500 is only up to 488, so in that hundred, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. So, each hundred except the last has 10 tens fours, and the last hundred (401-488) has 10 tens fours (440-449). So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That matches my earlier count. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, for the eights: units place:8,18,...,488. Each hundred has 10 units eights, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488: how many? From 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 408 is the first, then every 10 up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9. So, units eights:4 hundreds (1-400) each 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 401-488, total 49. That's correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens eights:49. Hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me just cross-verify with another approach. Another way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears. For units place, as we did, it's 49 fours and 49 eights. For tens place, 50 fours and 49 eights. For hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights. So, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+49+0=98 eights. Difference is 188-98=90. Yep, that seems consistent.

    "text": " Alternatively, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 4's in units place is 49, as before. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. 480-488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 480-489 would be 10, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, that's correct.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, but starting from 4, so 4 to 484 is 484 -4 =480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place:49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so from 40-49,140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. How many hundreds? From 0 to 400, so 4 sets (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right.
