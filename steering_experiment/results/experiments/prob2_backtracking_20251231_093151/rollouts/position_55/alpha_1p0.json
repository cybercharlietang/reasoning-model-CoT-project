From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, so total eights are 49+49=98. Wait, but in the units place, I had 49 eights, and in the tens place, also 49, so 98 total. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again.

That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th term because (484 -4)/10 +1=48 +1=49.

Wait, no, 49+49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place:50 fours. Hundreds place:89 fours. Total:49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the tens place for eights was 49, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, the sets are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for the units and tens places. For units place, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the ones digit. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (each contributing one 4), plus one more if the last page is 484, which it is. So, 48+1=49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same logic: 48 full groups, and since 488 ends with 8, that's 49. So, that's correct. Now, for the tens place, for 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? Up to 400-488. So, 400-488 is the fourth hundred. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 sets. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, which is the fourth hundred. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10)\n100-199:140-149 (10)\n200-299:240-249 (10)\n300-399:340-349 (10)\n400-488:440-449 (10) but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. So, that's correct. Now, for the eights in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the total eights in the tens place are 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, the fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place. Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. So, from 1-400: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. So, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights: 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98. So, the number of 8's is 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both digits. For 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units:8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. Thus, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but earlier when I was counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Wait, but when I count the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place:49, tens:49, total eights:98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the counting again, maybe I overcounted. Let's start with fours. Units place: numbers ending with 4 from 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights. Units place:8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block is 10 except the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units place, 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step)+1. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.

So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. Let me go through each digit again. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: (488//10)=48, plus 1 if 488%10 >=8, which it is (8=8). So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times d appears in tens place is (N // 100)*10 + something.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(0, (N % 100) - d*10 +1), 10)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of blocks.\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is d. So, for N=488, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 8 units.\n\nSo, for tens digit:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4.\n\nEach contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place in these 88 numbers? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total fours in tens place:4*10 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10 eights in tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place:4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times d appears in hundreds place is:\n\nIf d < the hundreds digit of N, then it's 100 per digit.\n\nIf d equals the hundreds digit, then it's (N % 100 +1).\n\nSo, for fours in hundreds place:\n\nN=488, hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, number of fours in hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nFor eights in hundreds place:\n\nSince 8 >4, there are 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one which might be cut short. So from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, units:49, tens:49, so total eights are 49+49=98. Wait, but let me check the units place again. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers, correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 0 to 484, stepping by 10, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 terms. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I missed something? For example, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For eights, since the book ends at 488, the last set in the tens place is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, I think the calculation is accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of '4' and '8' in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n1. **Units place:** '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0.

So, 89 fours in hundreds place. And in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place.
