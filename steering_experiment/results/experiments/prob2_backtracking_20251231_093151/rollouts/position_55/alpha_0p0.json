So 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0.

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 5 sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9).

Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.
