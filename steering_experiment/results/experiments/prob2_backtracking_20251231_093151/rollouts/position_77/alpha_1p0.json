    "text": " Wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. 4's:188. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using digit positions more systematically. For example, for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that again. **Units place:**\n- For 4: every 10 numbers, so total occurrences = floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, but 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n- For 8: same method. floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- For 4: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 488/100=4.88, so 4 full blocks. Each block contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (from 400-488) have the tens digit as 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 includes the tens digits from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place beyond the 4 full blocks? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4*10 +10=50. Correct.\n- For 8: Similarly, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (400-488) have the tens digit as 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n- For 8: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but our book only goes to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) =188\n- 8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position. Let me try that method to cross-verify.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\n**Units place:**\n- For 4's: Each block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488 /10=48.8), but since we're counting the units digit, the number of 4's is 48 full blocks (each contributing 1) plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours.\n- For 8's: Similarly, each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, plus 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- For 4's: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). So, for each 100, there are 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, actually, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50.\n- For 8's: Similarly, each 100 has 10 eights in the tens place (80-89). So, from 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights:40 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no eights here.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, for 4's, it's 89, but for 8's, it's 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Wait, let me check again. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
