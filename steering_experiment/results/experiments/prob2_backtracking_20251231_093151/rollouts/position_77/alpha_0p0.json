    "text": " I think that's correct. But let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8 and ensure that I didn't double-count or miss any. Another way is to think about how many times each digit appears in each position. For example, in the units place, for 4's: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Similarly, for 8's: same calculation, 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought that for the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49. Hmm, perhaps I should check that again. Wait, in the tens place, for 4's, it's 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. For 8's, it's 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 49 total. So, 50 vs 49. So, 4's have 50 in tens place, 8's have 49. That makes sense. Similarly, in hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately again. Let me try counting the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but we're only concerned with the tens digit.
