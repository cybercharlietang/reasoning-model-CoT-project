    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188-98 is 90? Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for fours? I said 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct. And units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th. So, 49 fours in units. And hundreds place: 89 fours. So, 188 total fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, right? Because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 +49=98. 188 -98=90.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades. But since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. That seems right. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? For units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 occurrences. So, units place for both is 49, which I think is correct. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights:49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me think again about the units place for fours. From 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. How many numbers is that? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, that's 9. So, total tens place eights:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place, I counted 49, which is correct because from 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 49, correct. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

The last number is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks give 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours than eights. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Maybe I should think about it differently. For the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89. For the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, 1-100: 40-49 is one block, 101-200:140-149, 201-300:240-249, 301-400:340-349, and 401-488:440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right. For the units place, every 10 numbers have one 4, so from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. How many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the tens place for eights. I thought that 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480-488: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total eights in the tens place are 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, which is 49. So, that seems right. I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers up to 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

The last occurrence is at 488, which is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, there are 5 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the 480-489 block, we only have up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, that's 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the tens place for fours and eights again. For fours in tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in tens place. For eights in tens place: 80-89(10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, the counts seem correct.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

    "text": " Let me add them again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, from 0 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8, which it is. So, 488 // 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again: units place had 49, tens place had 49, so 49+49=98. That seems right.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting fours:\n- Units: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nCounting eights:\n- Units: 49 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, with a common difference of 10. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 such blocks up to 400-499, but since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is okay. So, 5*10=50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see, 488 is the last term. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10=488 => (n-1)*10=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4 and common difference 10.  \n   The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484 \u2192 n = 49.  \n   So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.  \n   So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 8 and common difference 10.  \n   The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 n = 49.  \n   So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9 eights.  \n   So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, right? So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so does that count as the 49th? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want the last term to be \u2264488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264480. So, n-1 \u226448, so n \u226449. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. That's 4*10 +9=49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99+89=188.

    "text": " Let me add them again. 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me confirm that. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Hmm, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both fours and eights. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Well, 484 -4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, how many steps? 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10th number. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many, it's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 fours in units. Tens place: as before, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and the partial one. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. There are four full blocks: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4*10=40 eights. Now, the partial block is 480-488. How many numbers here have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488. So that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). Wait, 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me make sure. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Let me add 49 + 50 first, that's 99. Then 99 + 89: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10. Then 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, the first four blocks give 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9, so total of 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now for the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0.

    "text": " Let me add again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, now moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each set: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place again for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, in fours, we have 440-449 as the last set, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. That's correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98 eights. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many full blocks there are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block gives 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights more carefully. For fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50 fours in tens. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98.

It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: as before, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours.

Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488.

Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 eights there. So, total in tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again carefully.\n\nFirst, counting the fours:\n\n- Units place: From 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens. From 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: From 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 8 mod 10. So, the count is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each hundred block has 10, except the last one which has 9 because 488 is the end. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but 188-98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check if I missed any numbers.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct because 488 is beyond that, but does 440-449 contribute 10 fours? Yes, because each of those numbers has a 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for eights. The last number is 488, which is included, so units place eights are 49. Similarly, the tens place eights are 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nAnd fours are 188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a bit high. Let me see if there's another way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: same, 49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488 + 1)/100)*10 + extra in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, let's see. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, there's a block where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10 fours. So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit fours: 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit eights:\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributing 10 eights. So, in the first four hundreds, that's 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens digit eights: 40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the calculation seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me take a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages.\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCounting fours:\n\nUnits place: 4,14 \u2192 2 fours.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, there are no fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal fours: 2.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18 \u2192 2 eights.\n\nTens place: 80-89, but up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal eights: 2.\n\nSo, difference is 0, which makes sense because from 1-20, fours and eights appear equally in units place, and no other digits. So, 2-2=0.\n\nAnother example: 100 pages.\n\nFours:\n\nUnits: 10 (4,14,...,94).\n\nTens: 10 (40-49).\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal: 20 fours.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits: 10 (8,18,...,98).\n\nTens: 10 (80-89).\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal: 20 eights.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, but in 100 pages, the hundreds digit doesn't come into play, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the hundreds digit does come into play, so that's where the difference arises.\n\nSo, going back, in 488 pages, the hundreds digit adds 89 fours and 0 eights, which is where the extra comes from.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is the 49th number in the units place with 8. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks of 100 are there? Up to 380-389, which is 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. Then, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights:98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the tens place in 480-488 has 9 eights, so 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So 4*10=40 +9=49. So yes, tens place is 49, units place is 49, so total eights:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, it's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 480-489 is within 488, so we include that. So, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 times. Let me confirm: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that set is only up to 488. So, how many full sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds for eights: total 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me recount units. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last term is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. So yes, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 48\u00d710 +8. So, 488/10=48.8, so the number of terms is 49 (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's the calculation. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the units place for fours again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Starting at 4, every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, the hundreds place is 0, which is correct because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 90 is the correct difference.

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is page 488, which is included. So, units place has 49 eights? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 488 is page 488, but when we're counting the units digit, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, how many numbers from 1 to 488 have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 8 more in the 480-488 range. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of 4's = (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, so total 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of 8's = (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.  \n   Total 8's = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me add 49 + 50: that's 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Let me confirm: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets of 10 are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's 49. But let me think again. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 0-100: 80-89 (10), 100-200:180-189 (10), 200-300:280-289 (10), 300-400:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify. So, fours: 188, eights:98, difference is 90. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: up to 484, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188.

Now, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 fours, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred.

From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc., so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.

Hmm, but wait, when I thought about the units place, I considered up to 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 gives 49. That seems right. Tens place: each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-499), but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 400-488. Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Yes, that's correct.

From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, that's correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. That seems correct. But let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Yes. And for the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds=188 fours. For eights: units=49, tens=49. So, 98 eights. Difference=188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (from 400-488) = 49 eights. Wait, but that's 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me add 49 + 50 first, which is 99, then 99 +89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll use the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is the units digit 8 in the number 488. So, units place has 49 eights? Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is 488//10 +1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, it's 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, so the last block is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each hundred block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me recount that.\n\nIn the tens place, the 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, as before.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nNow, fours:188, eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for fours. Let me check that again.\n\nUnits place for fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that?\n\nThe formula is floor((488 -4)/10) +1.\n\nSo, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: same calculation, 49.\n\nTens place for fours:50, as we have 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place for fours:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for eights, hundreds place is 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for eights, I had 49, which included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nSo, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98 eights.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- Fours: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\n- Eights: same, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- Fours: in each hundred, 10 fours in tens place. From 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Eights: in each hundred, 10 eights in tens place. From 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- Fours: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- Eights: no numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences, except the last block.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488) with 9 occurrences.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400, 100-200, etc.), but wait, no. Actually, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The last term is 488, which is 488. So the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, contributing 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks up to 488, contributing 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, contributing 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me add them again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list a few: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting at 8, each step adds 10, so 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 blocks (400-499 is beyond 488, but 440-449 is within 488). Wait, no, actually, from 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total fours:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 eights each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**  \n   Number of fours (188) minus number of eights (98) equals 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
