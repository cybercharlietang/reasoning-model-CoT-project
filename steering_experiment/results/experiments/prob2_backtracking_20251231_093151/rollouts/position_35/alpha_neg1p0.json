    "text": " 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more fours than eights.

The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4\u00d710=40. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " 49 + 50 is indeed 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, is that correct? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the tens place for eights. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 188-98=90.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has only 9. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 188 -98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total: 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that's correct, but let me double-check the tens place for eights. The tens place eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. That's correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, step 10. So, the number is floor(488/10) +1 if 488 is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 because 8 is the first term, so 48+1=49. So, units place is 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't count any overlaps or miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place in fours, up to 440-449, which is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 50+49+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I was counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. But when I was counting the hundreds place for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nLet me recheck the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems right.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 8, 18, ..., 488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, fours total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights total: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, for 4's, it's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I can't do that right now, I'll try to recount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full tens, and then 488%10=8, which is less than 4, so no extra. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but the last group is 480-488, which includes 488. So, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each group, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full groups would give 48 fours, but the last group (480-488) has 9 numbers, which includes 484, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place fours:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic. 488//10=48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the last group (480-488) includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- For 4's: the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds? 488 is in the 400s, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages. Wait, no, actually, each hundred is 100 numbers. So, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in 1-100: 40-49:10 numbers. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. And 401-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: similar logic. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n- For 8's: 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me see if I can think of another way to count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula, but I'm not sure I remember it correctly. Let me try to recall.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nThe formula is something like:\n\nFor a given digit position (like units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\nhigher = n / (position * 10)\ncurrent = (n / position) % 10\nlower = n % position\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) * position\nelif current == d: count += higher * position + lower + 1\nelse: count += higher * position\n\nBut I might be misremembering the exact formula. Let me try to apply it for 4's and 8's.\n\nLet's take the units place first.\n\nFor units place, position =1.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nhigher = 488 / (1*10) =48\ncurrent = (488 /1) %10 =8\nlower =488 %1=0\n\nSince current (8) >4, count += (48 +1)*1=49. Which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\ncurrent=8, which is equal to d=8.\n\ncount += higher *1 + lower +1=48*1 +0 +1=49. Correct.\n\nNow, for tens place, position=10.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nhigher=488/(10*10)=4\ncurrent=(488/10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current (8) >4, count += (4+1)*10=50. Correct.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place:\n\nhigher=488/(10*10)=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8, count += higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place, position=100.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nhigher=488/(100*10)=0\ncurrent=(488/100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4, which is equal to d=4, count += higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89. Correct.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place:\n\nhigher=488/(100*10)=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\nSince current=4 <8, count += higher*100=0. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, we get the same counts as before. So, fours=188, eights=98, difference=90. So, I think my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many 4s in units place? The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units:49. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 eights. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for 8's, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for 4's, the last units place is 484, which is also the 49th occurrence. So, that seems consistent. For the tens place, 4's have 50, eights have 49.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences.

From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.

    "text": " 49 + 50 is indeed 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, which is 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188.

How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there?

The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10?

Yes, because the book ends at 488, so 800 isn't included. So, yes, no hundreds place eights. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units, total 98. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.

So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book since it goes up to 488.

So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So units place is 49, tens is 49, so total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when counting the units place, I included 488, which is correct because 488 is a valid page. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 is correct because 480 is the first number with 8 in the tens place in that block, and 488 is the last. So, 9 numbers there.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so 98 eights. Now, fours were 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 is 49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is given by the formula: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in page numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such blocks within 488 pages, contributing \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place in page numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) page numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Similar to 4's, this forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in page numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) occurrences.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[ 188 \\, (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is in the hundreds place, but in the units place, it's 8. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49.

How many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th because it's 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that's 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place, I thought it's 49, but let me check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens place? Wait, no, because in the tens place, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place is 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 488 - 480 = 8, so 8 +1 =9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188.

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, but wait: 488 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, so 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to confirm. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10, and there are 5 blocks, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last block has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we get 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.

Wait, no: 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488.

That's correct. For the tens place, in fours, we had 5 sets: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, which rounds up to 49. Correct. For eights: units place up to 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: up to 380-389, which is 4 sets, each 10, so 40. Correct. So, 188 fours and 89 eights. The difference is 99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? The first is 8, which is the 1st occurrence, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49. Let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct. And for the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place for fours was 49. So, that's correct. For eights, units place was 49, which is correct because 488 is included. Tens place was 49 because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems right. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract 98 from 188, I get 90. But let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me check the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. That's correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. That's correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., each 10, but the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, and 480-489 would be next, but since it's 488, we have 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 10 there are.

Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except the last one which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many sets of 10 are there?

Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 49 eights. Let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Using the same formula: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. Therefore, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights, the tens place goes up to 488, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights there. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights.

Because 480-489 would be 10, but the book ends at 488, so it's 480-488: that's 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in the tens place, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, that's correct. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I counted 89 fours because from 400-488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488-400+1=89. Correct. Units place for fours:49. Because from 4,14,...,484: that's (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours:50, because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:49, because 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:49, as above. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 0 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 49 (since 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 numbers). 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 also count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 1-400: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me recount that. For the tens place in fours, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For the units place, 4,14,...,484: from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For the eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40+9=49. Correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Let me count how many sets there are. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) which is 40, plus the 480s which is 9. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one would be 488. Let's see how many there are. Starting from 8, each step is +10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the numbers, maybe I missed something. Let me think again. For fours in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 eights. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right.
