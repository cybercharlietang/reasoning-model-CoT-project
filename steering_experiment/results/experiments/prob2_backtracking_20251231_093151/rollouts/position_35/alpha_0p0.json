    "text": " 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let me calculate: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 8 is the first one, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place? Each block contributes 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check how many sets there are. Each 100 numbers has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers (since 8, 18, ..., 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, so 98. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens and units places. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, +1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Correct. Now, eights: Units: 8,18,...,488. Let's use the same formula. (488 -8)/10=480/10=48, +1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: 0, as before. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:** '4' appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** '4' appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This gives 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:** '8' appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me confirm that. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems right. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

For fours: units place: from 4,14,...484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 too, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) have 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, does 480-488 have 9 numbers? Let's see: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place in the hundreds: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, is that right? 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, let me just cross-verify my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so this contributes 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\nNumber of fours - Number of eights = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98? Wait, but when I counted the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, and then 480-488 which is 9, so 40+9=49. So, yes, tens place is 49. Units place is 49, so total eights are 49+49=98. Wait, but I thought earlier that the hundreds place is 0, so total eights are 98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). The last term is 484. So, 484 = 4 + 10(n-1). 480 = 10(n-1), so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488. So, 488 = 8 +10(n-1). 480=10(n-1), so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. Total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? For the tens place in eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 is 49. Units place is 49, so total eights 98. Fours are 188, so 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49. Let me check: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 40, and 480-488 is 9, so 40+9=49. Yes, correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Yes. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to confirm. For 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 488 is less than 800. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, how many full blocks do we have? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 401-488. The tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place: in each 100, 10 numbers, so 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights:40+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens 49, so total 98. But wait, I just thought that 488 is included, so the last units digit 8 is at 488, which is correct. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, did I make a mistake in counting? Let me double-check. For fours: units place from 1-488: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. But wait, 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.

How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many numbers is that? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488.

Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place for eights: 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each set before that has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. That seems correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights 98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit is 4, which affects the count. Let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by looking at each digit position separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\n- For fours: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 fours in the units place.\n\n- For eights: similarly, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\n- For fours: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). Since we have 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, etc.), but our book ends at 488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred except the last one, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, from 1-99: 40-49:10 fours. 100-199:140-149:10 fours. 200-299:240-249:10 fours. 300-399:340-349:10 fours. 400-488: the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, so 440-449 is fully included. So that's 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 10*5=50.\n\n- For eights: similarly, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, 1-99:80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10 eights. 200-299:280-289:10 eights. 300-399:380-389:10 eights. 400-488: the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- For fours: the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n- For eights: the hundreds digit is 8 would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yep, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but does 488 count as the units digit? Wait, 488 is 4 8 8, so the units digit is 8, so yes, it's included. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both digits to confirm. For fours: units: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens:40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units:8,18,...,488. How many? The last one is 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this.

So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to check. So, the sets are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

Wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers in this last set. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again because I might have made a mistake. Wait, when I calculated the units place for 4's, I got 49, which seems correct. Tens place: 50, correct. Hundreds:89, correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Units place for 8's is 49, same as for 4's. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place more carefully. Let's do units, tens, hundreds separately for both digits. **Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of times is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n\n- **Tens place:** How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400-488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=49.\n\n- **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So:\n\n  - 80-89:10\n  - 180-189:10\n  - 280-289:10\n  - 380-389:10\n  - 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers)\n\n  So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit might not be present in lower page numbers, but I think I accounted for that by separating into units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\n**Units place:**\n\nFor any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the last digit is >=d else 0). But since N is 488, which is a multiple of 10? No, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10)=48. But since the last number with 4 in units is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so floor is 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49. Similarly for 8's, last is 488, which is included, so 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated by:\n\nFor each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial hundred (400-488). \n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\n- For 4: in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 once every 100 numbers, contributing 10 numbers each. So, 4 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, and then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 5*10=50.\n\n- For 8: in each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 once every 100 numbers, contributing 10 numbers each. So, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, and in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\n- For 4: appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- For 8: since the book doesn't go beyond 488, hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, again, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and hundreds places, there might be overlaps or miscalculations. Let me try another approach by considering each position separately and using a formula.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current digit position as pos (starting from 0 for units, 1 for tens, 2 for hundreds, etc.), and the divisor as 10^(pos+1), the remainder as N mod 10^(pos+1), and the higher number as N divided by 10^(pos+1).\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^pos + min(max(digit - 1, 0) * 10^pos + 1, remainder - d * 10^pos + 1)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let me try applying it for 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to stick with the initial method since the numbers are manageable.\n\nWait, another way: Let's list out how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\n**Units place:**\n\n- For 4: as calculated, 49 times.\n- For 8: 49 times.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\n- For 4:50 times.\n- For 8:49 times.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\n- For 4:89 times.\n- For 8:0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think this is correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes, that seems correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book only goes up to 488, so it's 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets, 40 eights. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 40 eights. Now, the last partial set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences each? Wait, but for fours in units place, from 4,14,...,484, that's 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, from 8,18,...,488, that's 49 numbers. So, both units places are correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. So, adding up, fours: 49+50+89=188, eights:49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. Tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yep, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 occurs 49 times? Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's every 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for fours, I thought 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Similarly, for the eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488-480=8, but including both endpoints, it's 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the eights in tens place are 49, which is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, the calculation seems correct.

So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) give 40, plus 9, so 49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for eights would be zero, which it is, so that seems right. Let me just check if I counted correctly for the units and tens places. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 8,18,...,488. Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, up to 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. And 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: Each hundred block (except the last one) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks (1-400) would be 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, it's 9 more, so 40+9=49. Yeah, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is 48*10 +4, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 is a set of 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full sets of 10 are there? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.
