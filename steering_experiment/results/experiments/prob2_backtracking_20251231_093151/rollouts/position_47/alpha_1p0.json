    "text": " Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

But wait, let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems right. And for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50. That seems correct. And in the hundreds place, fours go from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours there. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Counting eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's the result. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400+1=89. And in the tens place for fours, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, 484 is the last one. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) =484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the others up to 380-389 is 10 each, so that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then 480-488 is 9, so total is 40+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many full sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many, we can calculate (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for tens place in fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set (480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, total 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts. Wait, when I was counting the units place for fours, I got 49, and for eights, I also got 49. Then tens place for fours was 50, and for eights, 49. Hundreds place for fours was 89, and for eights, 0. So, fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I thought about the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place. Wait, in the tens place, 440-449 would have 4 in both tens and hundreds, but I think I counted each occurrence separately, which is correct. Similarly, in the units place, 484 has a 4 in units and hundreds, but each digit is counted separately. So, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90. Wait, but wait a second. Let me recount the units place for fours. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. For the tens place, fours:40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, let me check that. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 10*4=40 plus 9, which is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the units place for fours. From 4,14,24,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers, correct. For tens place, 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

The sequence is 4 + 10k where k=0 to 48. So, 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks =50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct. Total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting 8's again:**\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. The sequence is 8 +10k where k=0 to 48. So, 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four blocks have 10 each, total 40. The last block from 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total tens place eights:40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: none. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
