    "text": " Let me count how many numbers that is. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. For the tens place, I considered 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then each subsequent hundred block up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 9, not 10. So, adding up: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. And for the fours, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place: 49 fours, tens place:50 fours, so total 188 fours. And eights: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. When I was counting the units place for fours, I included 484, which is correct, and that gives 49. Similarly, for eights, units place up to 488 is 49. So, yes, 49 each. Tens place for fours: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Tens place for eights: 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 50 fours in tens place vs 49 eights. So, the total fours are 49+50+89=188, and eights are 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Yes, correct. For the tens place in fours, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, and each of the other sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.) is 10 each, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct.

    "text": " Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Checking eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I thought 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is correct. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of fours and eights in each position again. For fours: Units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, the last set is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as 800+ is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Let's recheck the hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488.

From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, in the tens place, we have 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me add them up: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49.

Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8 and ending at 488.

The first four blocks contribute 40 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let's count each block. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, so that's 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.
