The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place because 489 is beyond 488. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.

    "text": " But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each full hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49 eights. Wait, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, in the hundreds, like 140-149, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449) each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, total fours 188. Eights: units place from 8 to 488, which is (488-8)/10 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, with 5 sets in total, giving 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1), contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four sets each contribute 10 numbers, while the last set (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for eights, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 10 in each of the first four sets, and 9 in the last. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, the total number of eights is 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.
