Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

This is 49 times (similar to '4's in units place).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because it stops at 488, not 489. So, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that the hundreds place was 0, but let me confirm. Yes, since the book only has up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, total eights are 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I thought the answer might be different. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But wait, 400 is page 400, and 488 is the last page. So, 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is correct. So, 50 in tens. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (488-480+1=9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not correct.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Then, tens place: 50 fours, and units:49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct.

For the fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct? 488 - 400 +1=89. Yes. And in the tens place, 5 sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5*10=50. Units place: from 4,14,...484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor the eights: units place, 49 numbers (8,18,...488). Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The last block has 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each hundred has a 40-49, but for 8 in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights in the page numbers. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units and tens places for eights. For units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. For tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.
