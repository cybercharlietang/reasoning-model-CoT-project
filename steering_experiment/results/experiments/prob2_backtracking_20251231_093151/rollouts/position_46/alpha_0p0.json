    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When I counted the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. And fours are 188. So, the difference is 90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's = 49 (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's = 49 (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Number of 8's = 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThere are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

That's 4 sets of 10, so 40 eights. But wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), does the tens digit ever reach 8? Yes, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8 for numbers 480-488.

Let me double-check my calculations because 188-98 is 90, but maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount. Let me check the units place for fours: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. That's correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 8 + 48*10, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I just thought, when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place in eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which I included. So, all counts seem accurate.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 4*10=40 from the first four blocks, plus 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's would have more, but maybe that's correct. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately again to confirm. For fours: units: numbers ending with 4. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 4. That's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks. 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units: numbers ending with 8. 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 =488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u219210(n-1)=480 \u2192n-1=48\u2192n=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 8. 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.

Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the units place for 4's again. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. For tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488).

Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just go through the counts again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right.

    "text": " Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

That's 5 sets, but the last set only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours, in the tens place, we had 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Wait, but in the hundreds place for fours, we had 89 fours, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.
