    "text": " How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems high. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. That's correct.

The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I count correctly? Let me just verify the counts again, because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. For 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, total 49. Correct. Hundreds:0.

Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98.

So, let's count how many sets of 10 there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, which is 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Wait, but when I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges gives 10 eights, and the last gives 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400-488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49. So, 98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.

Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount anywhere. Let me check the tens place for fours: from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449, which is within 488. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.

Each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full sets (since 480-489 is the fifth set but only up to 488). Wait, no: 80-89 is the first, 180-189 second, 280-289 third, 380-389 fourth, and 480-488 is the fifth, but only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place.

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit 8, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. Yep. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check all the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 49, which seems correct because 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contribute 10, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).

    "text": " The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Yep, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, making the tens place count 50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Let me see how many terms: 484 is 484, so (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 90. Let me think again. Maybe I miscounted somewhere. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400=88, so 88+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That's correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks. 5*10=50 fours. Correct. Units place:4,14,...,484. 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. Total:49+50+89=188. Eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total:98.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many sets of 100 numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's, units: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) and 9, totaling 49. Hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90 as the difference, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach to count the digits. Let's consider each digit position separately for both fours and eights. For units digit: For fours, as before, 49. For eights, 49. Tens digit: fours:50, eights:49. Hundreds digit: fours:89, eights:0. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any cases. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, does 400-488 include all the fours? Yes, because 400 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 89 numbers. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct.

    "text": " The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9 =49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full decades and one partial. Each full decade gives 10 eights, so 4*10=40, and the partial gives 9 eights (from 480-488). So, 40+9=49. That's correct. For the fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours there. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. Let me see how many terms that is. The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place for fours: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, and since 488 is beyond 400, we have 5 such blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total of 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 eights. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
