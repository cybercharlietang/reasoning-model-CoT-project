    "text": " The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, how many eights are there? Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 of them. So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that's only 98 eights? Let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 98 total. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check again. For units place, from 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. For tens place, as we saw, 49 eights. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the tens place has 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check: units 49, tens 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: 50 (5 blocks of 10 each).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (4 full blocks of 10 and 9 in the last partial block).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full sets are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.

So, no eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks exist. From 0-488, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), right? Because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the tens place 8's are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49 eights in the tens place. Let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Yes, that adds up to 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98.

Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would be part of that range. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last partial block contributing 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I had 5 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial set 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That's correct.

The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.

Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 484, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place, from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the counts seem accurate.

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many such numbers. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, does 480-488 count as another set? Let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 in all of them, but since the hundreds digit is 4, it's still part of the tens place. So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9.

Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check again if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, yes, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49. So, 98 eights. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many numbers that is. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, so each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I was counting fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, I might have miscounted the hundreds place. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. When counting fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.

That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the 480-489 range. So, how many numbers is that? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last block (480-488) has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
