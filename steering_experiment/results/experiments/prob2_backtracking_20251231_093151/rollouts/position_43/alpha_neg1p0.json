Wait, 480-488 is part of the book since it's up to 488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly check if I did everything right. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference is 188-98=90. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake, but let me just think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which has 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, but inclusive, so 9). Let me check each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, which is included. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, yes. So, each of the first four sets has 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. When I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each, and the last block from 480-488 has 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 98 eights total. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- **Total:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last block contributing 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: let's see, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1=9. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, which would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 4 full sets (40) plus 9, which is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place, I had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers from 400 to 488. So, 488-400+1=89. That's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount that. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a 90 difference. But let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And in the tens place, each hundred block from 1-400 has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) would be 40, but wait, 440-449 is also within 488, so that's the fifth set, making it 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 49 numbers (8,18,...,488). Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set from 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90, but let me check my calculations again. Wait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I got 49, which seems correct because from 4,14,...,484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 4 full sets of 10, and one partial set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: when I counted the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book ends at 488. So, yes, 90 seems to be the correct difference.

For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately and sum them up. Wait, maybe I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should write out a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with pages 1-20. How many 4's and 8's? 4's: 4,14 \u2192 units place: 2, and 40-49 isn't in this range, so tens place: 0. Hundreds place:0. So, total 2 fours. 8's: 8,18 \u2192 units:2, tens: 80-89 not in range, so 0. So, 2 eights. So, 2-2=0. That makes sense. Now, using my method: units for 4's: from 4 to 20, every 10: 4,14 \u2192 2. Tens: 40-49 not in range, so 0. Hundreds:0. Total 2 fours. Units for 8's:8,18 \u21922. Tens:80-89 not in range, so 0. Hundreds:0. Total 2 eights. So, 2-2=0. Correct. So, my method works for this small example.

    "text": " The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be right because I might have overcounted somewhere. Let me check each part again. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (since 400-449 is the last, but wait, 400-449 is 50 numbers, but in terms of tens places, each 100 block has one set of 10. Wait, from 0-99: 40-49 is one set. 100-199:140-149. 200-299:240-249. 300-399:340-349. 400-488:440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I think about it, the hundreds place for fours includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But in the tens place for fours, we have 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so we're not double-counting, right? Because in the hundreds place, we're counting all the 400-488, and in the tens place, we're counting the 440-449, which is part of that. So, each page number can have multiple digits, but each digit is counted separately. So, for example, 440 has two 4's: one in the hundreds place and one in the tens place. So, in our counting, we're correctly counting each occurrence, regardless of how many digits the number has. So, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page numbers (since the book ends at 488). This is 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers each. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. But wait, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, for 480-488, we have 9 eights instead of 10. So, the tens place total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 -400 +1=89. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n -6=484. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, right?

So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the hundreds place, it's 4, but in the tens place, it's 4 in 40-49,140-149, etc. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so 5 blocks would give 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place eights:49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks give 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Number of terms is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each (40 total), and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of fours: 188\n   - Number of eights: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page). Wait, is that right? Let me check: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, the last block has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each hundred has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, ..., 400-488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each hundred has 10 such numbers, except the last range which has 9 numbers (480-488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Let me just quickly verify my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the units place, fours: 4,14,...,484: 484 is 480 +4, so 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449: that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188.

Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place from that block. So, yes, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I first thought about the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me check that: 488-400=88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 88+1=89. Correct.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, is 480-488 inclusive? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me calculate how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I thought about the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, which is correct. But for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, maybe the answer is indeed 90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place again for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 fours there. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check that again. The units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, how many numbers is that? Let's calculate (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. So, the counts seem accurate.
