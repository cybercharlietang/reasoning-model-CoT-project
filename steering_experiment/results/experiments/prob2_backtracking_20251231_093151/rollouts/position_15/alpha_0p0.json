    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0). 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is less than 4? Wait, no, 8 is greater than 4, so I think I should add 1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 blocks with 8 remaining numbers. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems right. Let me confirm: from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then 481-488: 484 is the only number where units digit is 4. So total 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in blocks where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is the 4th block (since 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, then 40-49). Then 140-149, which is the 14th block, and so on. Wait, but up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many complete blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers apart. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Now, after 440-449, the next block would be 540-549, but since we only go up to 488, that block isn't complete. So, do we have any more numbers where the tens digit is 4 beyond 440-449? Let's see, 450-488: the tens digit here is 5, so no. So, total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, but now looking for 8's. So, in each block of 10, the units digit is 8 once. From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48 blocks with 8 remaining numbers. Each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has a units digit of 8. So, that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many complete blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers apart. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck the 4's first. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, for the 8's: Units place: 49. Tens place: 49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) contributing 48 fours.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 contributes one more 4.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has a 40-49 block, contributing 10 fours.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) contributing 48 eights.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 contributes one more 8.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has an 80-89 block, contributing 10 eights.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40 eights.\n   - The 480-488 block contributes 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more 4 in the units place. Wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Oh, so there are 49 occurrences in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by taking the integer part. So, the correct number is 49. Let me verify: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, and the last is 484. The count is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but since we're only going to 488, the tens place 4's in 480-488 are still valid because 480-488 are included. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, not 4. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, let's count each range. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484 - 4}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 8}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. How many such sets are there? From 1 to 488, the sets are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so that's 49 times? Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 5 sets, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers with 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so it's 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 48 full times. But wait, 484 is included, so actually, it's 49 times because 4 is the first one and 484 is the 49th. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) which is 48 full decades, but since 488 is beyond 480, we might have an extra. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. Let me list the numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The total number is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49, that's one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and 1 range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149, and so on. The last block before 488 would be 440-449, because 450-459 would be next, but 488 is beyond that. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block). From 100-199: 140-149 (another block). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes one 4. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8\u00d749=392, which is not correct. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers). Next, 180-189, then 280-289, and 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many full blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Then, 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers every 100: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (from 0-99 to 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Since 488 ends with 8, total occurrences: floor(488 \u00f7 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers every 100: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10.\n   - Partial block: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers are in each range: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges each with 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Starting from 8, each step is 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n\nWait, does 480-489 fall within the book? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the book. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place in 480-488 is 8 in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, and then 480-488 has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 8's. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Let me check: 4 + 47*10 = 4 + 470 = 474, but 484 is the next one, so maybe it's 49 times? Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by taking the floor of N/10. So for 488, floor(488/10) = 48. So 48 times in the units place. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So for each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 480, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In those 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place again. So total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (tens digit 4), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's calculate how many times. Using floor(488/10)=48, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check: 488 has an 8 in the units place, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many blocks? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (48) + tens (40) = 88. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 88 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 40, so 88. 187-88=99. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So 89 times, correct. And for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, so 50, correct. Units place: 48, correct. So 187 4's. For 8's: units 48, correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, so 40, correct. So 88 8's. So 187-88=99. So the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I just thought of something. When counting the units place for 8's, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 ends with 8, so it's included in the 48 count. Similarly, for 4's, 484 is included in the units place count. So I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer is 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. So, it's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is in the 100s, 140-149 in the 200s, 240-249 in the 300s, 340-349 in the 400s, and 440-449 in the 500s. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges exist within 488. 80-89 is in the 100s, 180-189 in the 200s, 280-289 in the 300s, 380-389 in the 400s. Now, 380-389 is within 488, so that's four ranges. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers, right? Because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, actually, 484 is the 48th number because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that makes sense because from 4 to 484, inclusive, there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 4. Let me confirm: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist within 1-488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I need to check if 400-488 is correct. Let me calculate: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range:\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers\n   - 180-189: 10 numbers\n   - 280-289: 10 numbers\n   - 380-389: 10 numbers\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n   So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, that's 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me go through my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nAnd for the tens place, for 4's, I had 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges but the last one was only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nYes, I think my calculations are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group would be 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 still appears once in 484, which is within 481-488. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check: 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once in each group of 10, from 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many times? The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9 up to 488. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit 8 appears once in each group of 10. So, the number of times is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, but since 488 is the last page, we have an extra 8 in 488. Wait, no, because 488 is the 489th page (since pages start at 1). Wait, let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit is 8 from 1 to 488. So, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need the largest n such that 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 terms. Wait, but 8 + 48*10 = 8 + 480 = 488, which is the last page. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I was wrong before. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Let's count each group: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page) So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. Each of the first four groups (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last group, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49. Total: 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Yes, that seems right. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers) 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers) 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers) 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers) 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is only 4 for numbers 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: the first 8 is at 8, then 18, ..., 488. So, how many numbers? The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each ten numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th number because 488 is the last number in the 488th position. So, does that mean 49 8's in the units place? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think again. The first 8 is at 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 is the 49th. So, yes, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8's in tens place: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So total: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Let me check the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, does that mean 49? Wait, no, because the units digit cycles every 10. So, 4 appears in the units place at 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought units place for 4's was 48, but it's actually 49. Because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, that means I overcounted the 4's by 1. So, units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Wait, that's different from before. Let me recalculate. So, units place for 4's: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place:89. So, 49 +50=99, plus 89 is 188. Now, for 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, difference is 188 -98=90. Hmm, so I think I initially undercounted the 4's in the units place by 1, which changes the total difference from 89 to 90. Let me confirm this. The units digit for 4's: starts at 4, ends at 484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in the units place. Earlier, I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, 48 times the 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are four complete sets of 100: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, each set of 100 has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. So, in each 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such 100 blocks do we have? From 1-400, that's four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times the 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times the 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, let me check that again. 48 + 50 is indeed 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, no, because 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. Wait, but 488 is the 49th because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, no, that's not the right way. Each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 itself is included, so does that add an extra 8? Let me see: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times in the units place. Wait, let me confirm: numbers ending with 8 from 1-488 are 8,18,28,...,488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count each block: a. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. b. 180-189: another 10. c. 280-289: another 10. d. 380-389: another 10. e. 480-488: how many? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so the last block (400-488) contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, total is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each 100-block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 50 (40 in the first four blocks, 10 in 440-449).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (including 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each 100-block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Let me list the numbers: starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, right? Let's see. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers. But wait, each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. But wait, let me check: 400 is included, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189:10 numbers. From 200-299:280-289:10 numbers. From 300-399:380-389:10 numbers. From 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but 0 in the hundreds place would mean two-digit numbers, which is from 40-49. So, that's 5 sets of ten. Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last set go up to 449? Because the book has 488 pages, so 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 isn't, but that's okay because we're only considering up to 449. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, starting from 8, the next is 18, and so on. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is included, but 489 isn't. So, how many sets of ten? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total sets: 4 full sets (each 10 numbers) and one partial set with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.

It's 48 because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 48th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place, 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 0-99: 1 range (80-89), 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one with 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, total 8's printed are 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 48, because from 8,18,...,488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. So, 48+49=97. So, 4's are 187, 8's are 97, difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " But wait, let me check: starting from 4, every 10th number has a 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The number of times is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10 numbers) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades. Each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. Let me check if 488 has a 4 in the units place. 488 is 4-8-8, so no, the units digit is 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Now, how many of these ranges are there? Let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's a range where the tens digit is 4. So, 0-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149, 10 numbers. 200-299:240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399:340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488:440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, let me think. The first occurrence is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 after 8. Wait, but 8 is 8, then 18 is 18, which is 10+8, so each step is +10. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades in 488. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another. So, 8 is the 1st, 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms in this sequence is given by ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299:280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399:380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488:480-489, but wait, 480-489 is within 400-488? Wait, 480-489 is from 480 to 489, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's adjust. So, the ranges where the tens digit is 8 are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: from 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10. 400-488:480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can never be 8. Therefore, hundreds place:0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributing 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributing 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, starting from 4, the next is 14, so that's 4,14,24,...,484. Let me see: from 0 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if 488's units digit is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer division gives 48, but since 488's units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, we add 1 more? Wait, no, because we're only considering the units digit. Wait, maybe it's better to calculate it as floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, 488 /10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. The units digit is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1, making it 49. But wait, does that include 484? Let me check: 484 is the last number with 4 in the units place before 488. So from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks *10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is up to 449, which is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, 50 numbers. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488's units digit is 8, we add 1, so 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count the blocks. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block of 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49)=98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4 as the 1st, each subsequent 10 pages add another 4. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so actually, there are 49 occurrences in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by taking the integer part. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: from 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? Since the book ends at 488, the range would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, when I start from 4, the first number is 4, and then every 10th number after that. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers is that? Let's see, the formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the last range, 440-449, does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit, so each number contributes one 4. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: There's no 480-489 because the book ends at 488. So, 480-488 would only go up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, let me adjust. The first four ranges are complete: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I thought of 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, every 10th number adds another 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place is 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, there are 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks exist. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 times because 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the last number is an 8. Since 488 ends with 8, it's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks exist. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:40. Total 89. So, 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, that's correct.

    "text": " But wait, let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So that's correct, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. Each set has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So 5 sets, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to page 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean 49 times? Because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 1*9=9, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that's a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units place: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89, total 187. For the 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0, total 98. So, 187 - 98 is indeed 89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I counted the units and tens correctly. For units place of 4: from 4,14,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 48 times. Correct. For tens place of 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, so how many? Let's see, 488 /10 is 48.8, so 49 times. Correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, the last has 9, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49 +49=98. So, 187 -98=89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " But wait, let me check that. From 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're counting complete groups of 10, it's 48 times. However, I think I made a mistake here because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me confirm by considering the range. The numbers ending with 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. These numbers are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. The highest range is 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 440-449. So, how many ranges? 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. These are numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many terms? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid, but 489 isn't. So, let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's) =90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which is true for all these numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same approach: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since pages go up to 488).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that's 48 times. But let me check: from 4 to 484, that's every 10th number, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times, not 48. Because when you include both the start and end, you have to add 1. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, when considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For the 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 188. For the 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I did the hundreds place correctly for 4's. Let me think again: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount that. 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Okay, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the units digit cycles 48 full times, and then one more number (484) which is within 488. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th occurrence in the units place. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. In each group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does the 48th group end at 480, and then 481-488 are the remaining 8 numbers. So in the units place, 484 is within the 48th group, so that's 48 times. So units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, since 488 is beyond 449. Let's count how many such sets there are. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is the number of complete groups of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think: 8, 18, ..., 488. So from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So for the first four sets, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would happen from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 eights in the hundreds place. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)  \n   However, since 484 is included, we add 1:  \n     \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\)  \n   Correction: Upon reevaluation, the correct count is 48 (as 484 is within the 48th group).  \n   So, **48 fours**.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers.  \n     \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)  \n   So, **50 fours**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears from 400-488.  \n   - Number of numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)  \n   So, **89 fours**.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rceil = 49 \\)  \n   So, **49 eights**.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of ranges: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).  \n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, last contributes 9.  \n     \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)  \n   So, **49 eights**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   So, **0 eights**.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\)\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 0. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, so 480/10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me double-check. For units place: 4,14,...,484: 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So total 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 block of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again. The tens digit being 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 0-399, there are 4 blocks of 10 numbers each where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. And in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. That's 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. So, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n1. **Units place:** '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, the last block is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers, but the tens place is 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, each full hundred has 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many full hundreds there are. From 0-399, that's four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 4 occurs from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full hundred has 10 8's in the tens place. From 0-399, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens place 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 hundreds (0-488).\n   - However, the last block (440-449) is fully within 488, so total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 hundreds.\n   - However, the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers, so total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, starting from 4, the next is 14, which is 10 numbers apart. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 (since we include both the first and last). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units digit. Since every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4. So, total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes one 4. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is 488, which is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges * 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units: 49, tens: 49. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of pages is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. That seems correct. For 8's, in the units place, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 1-100, the second 101-200, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, how many complete hundreds are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. So, how many complete hundreds blocks are there where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 440-449, which is complete because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 < 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8 + (48-1)*10 = 8 + 470 = 478. Wait, but 488 is also an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 8's in the units place. Wait, let me double-check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, so 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 101-200: 180-189 (10) From 201-300: 280-289 (10) From 301-400: 380-389 (10) From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484}{10} = 48.4 \\) \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:** \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of ten numbers each. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens. So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The first is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 would be the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 8's. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 8's. Tens place: 49 8's. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct. And units place: 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but earlier when I counted the 4's, I had 187, and 8's as 98, so 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me check the 4's again. Units place: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. So, the sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, so that's 49 terms, meaning 49 4's in the units place. But earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct? Let's see: 4 is the first, then 14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in the units place. But earlier I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake there. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things. So, let me correct that. Units place 4's:49. Tens place 4's:50. Hundreds place 4's:89. So, total 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so earlier I had 187 4's, but now it's 188. So, the correct count is 188 4's and 98 8's, so 188-98=90 more 4's. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count of units place 4's. It should be 49, not 48. Because 484 is included, which is the 49th term. So, the correct total is 188 4's. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check again. Units place 4's:4,14,24,...,484. How many? Let's see, from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49. So, units place 4's:49. Tens place 4's:50. Hundreds place 4's:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as a page? Yes, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, 8's go up to 488, which is the 49th term. So, units place 8's:49. Similarly, 4's in units place go up to 484, which is the 49th term. So, 49 4's in units place. So, the total 4's are 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 90. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 484 is 484, so actually, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, okay, let's move on to counting the 8's and see if that makes sense. Now, counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is 488, which is the 48th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Let me count the ranges: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8, so for each hundred, there's a range where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10. From 200-299: 280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can't be 8 in any page number. So, hundreds place contributes 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have overcounted or undercounted. Let me go through each digit position again for both 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: Units place: From 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought it was 48, but actually, using the formula, it's 49. Because the first term is 4, the last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 -4)/10 = 480/10=48. So, n=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (from 0-99 to 400-488). So, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, as before. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Wait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the units place earlier. Let me recalculate. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place:5 ranges, each 10 numbers:50. Hundreds place:89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place:49. Hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but now I'm getting the same number, but with corrected counts. Let me check again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any ranges. For 4's: units=49, which includes 4,14,...,484. That's correct because 484 is the last one. Tens=50: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds=89:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49:8,18,...,488. Correct. Tens=49:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49. So, total 8's=49+49=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. The range is 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's actually 49 times because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 in the 480-488 range. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that's a positive number, so there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 187. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Wait, earlier I thought there were 5 ranges for 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 is correct. Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Units place for 4's: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but wait, does 488 count as a 4 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8, so the 4 in the units place is at 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the last one before 488, which ends with 8. So, 48 times. For 8's in units place, 488 is included, so it's 49 times. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " But wait, when I check 484, that's the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Hmm, actually, maybe a better way is to calculate it as (484 - 4) / 10 + 1. So, (480) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right because from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. Each decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the 480th page, 480 has a 4 in the hundreds place, but in the units place, 484 is the last one. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: For units digit 4, the numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149: another 10. From 201-300: 240-249: another 10. From 301-400: 340-349: another 10. From 401-488: 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189:10. From 201-300:280-289:10. From 301-400:380-389:10. From 401-488:480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks each have 10, and the last block has 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Now, the difference is 188 - 98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 4 as the first. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many sets is that? From 0-399, there are four sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10. So that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, 440-449 is another 10. So total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position separately. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's compute (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set contributes 9. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers because 484 is the 48th occurrence after 4. Wait, no, actually, 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488-400+1=89. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct because 440 is within 400-488. And for 8's in the tens place, I correctly accounted for 480-488 being only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 = 4 + 10*(49-1)).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 488 = 8 + 10*(49-1)).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, it's 0-48, so 49 numbers. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's calculate each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 numbers each and 1 block with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9 =40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 + 10*(48-1) = 484. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, no, let me check that again. Actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 4's. But wait, the last group ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 at 484. So, that's actually 49 occurrences. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. Each group of 10 numbers contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 4's. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 4's in the units place. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 is less than 490, so perhaps it's 48 complete groups and then an incomplete group. Let me think again. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each ten's place, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten, there's exactly one 4. So, how many tens are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, in each of the 48 full tens, there's one 4, so 48 4's. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), we check if there's a 4 in the units place. 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 4's in the units place. Okay, that seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449. Let's see how many full ranges there are. Each hundred has a range where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers per hundred. So, from 1-99, we have 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299, 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399, 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488, 440-449: 10 numbers? Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? Up to 400-488, that's four full hundreds (1-399) and then 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 sets (1-399) would give 4*10=40 4's in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, we have 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, and the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The total number of terms can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is a bit trickier. The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers. Therefore, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Therefore, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89. That's correct. For the tens place of eights, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488-480+1=9. Correct. So, that part is right. Units place for eights: 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Similarly, units place for fours goes up to 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. So, yeah, I think 90 is the correct difference. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Occurs in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Occurs in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Occurs in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. Let me count how many full decades there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many full decades: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 180-189 is another 10. 280-289 is another 10. 380-389 is another 10. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
