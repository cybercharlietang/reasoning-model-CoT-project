    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first, each 10 numbers adds another 4. So, 484 is the 49th 4 in the units place. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Let me verify that: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 itself doesn't end with a 4. The last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place to be 4, the page numbers would be from 400-488. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me double-check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But 488 itself is 488, so that's an additional 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count? Yes, because it's page 488, which ends with an 8. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges there are within 1-488. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of this range. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the number of 8's is: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the partial range 480-488 contributing 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 numbers here (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences, plus 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's one such range. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10 numbers. 240-249: 10 numbers. 340-349: 10 numbers. 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's check how many such ranges exist up to 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-489: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place in the tens digit, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full ranges do we have? 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: that's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Plus the partial range 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place that have 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including the partial range 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 would be at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, and then 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, because 488 is included, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in 1-480, units digit 8 occurs 48 times (8, 18, ..., 478). Then, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would happen in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, from 4 to 484, that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, in the hundreds place, 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times? Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's check: 8*1=8, 8*2=16, ..., 8*60=480, 8*61=488. So, 61 numbers? Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the 61st multiple of 8, but we're looking for the 8 in the units place every 10 numbers. Wait, no, that's a different approach. Alternatively, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the 49th decade is 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). But in the units place, 8 appears once in each decade, so 48 times from 10 to 480, and then in 488, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 40+9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n   - Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 488, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another set, 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10. So 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but let's check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-489 is beyond 488, so it's only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 (which is the first), each subsequent 10 numbers add another 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th number. So, there are 49 instances where 4 appears in the units place. But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than or equal to 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449. Since 449 is less than 488, that's fine. So, 50 instances. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 instances where 4 is in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another 8 in the units place. The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 instances. Wait, 8, 18, 28,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 instances. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, that's one more range: 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 instances. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 instances. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, that would give us 48 4's in the units place. But wait, let me check that. If I consider from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. From 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? Well, 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that makes sense because 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488, and then 484 is within 481-488. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, where the digit 4 appears. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49 (1st), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. So 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me check if I made any mistakes. For units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which gives 48 4's, and then in the last partial cycle (481-488), 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 in units. Tens place: Each hundred has a 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, 10 numbers; 101-200, another 10; 201-300, another 10; 301-400, another 10; and 401-488, 40-49 is 10, but wait, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, no, actually, 40-49 in each hundred. So, in 1-100: 40-49, 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149, 10 numbers. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. 401-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 8's. But wait, does 488 itself end with an 8? Yes, so in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges (except maybe the last one) is 10 numbers. So, let's count them. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 set of 9 (from 401-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-100: 10 8's in tens place. 101-200: another 10. 201-300: another 10. 301-400: another 10. Then 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of 4's, we had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 49, as we determined. So, 188 4's. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 4's.\n   - The last partial cycle (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles, contributing 48 8's.\n   - The last partial cycle includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 8's, with the last range (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (800-899).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But wait, 484 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last range: 440-449 is 10 numbers, and since 449 is less than 488, that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, because starting from 8, which is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see: 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, but 484 is page 484, which is within 481-488. So, the units digit 4 appears 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the last page has a units digit >=4. Wait, but maybe a better approach is to consider that in each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Okay, so units place has 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. Wait, but let me confirm: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49 inclusive is 10 pages. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, tens place has 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, but we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 89 4's. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. 8 is not a hundreds digit here because 800 is beyond 488. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 48*10=480, so 484 is the 49th. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, maybe it's better to use a formula. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1) / 10). Let me test this with a smaller number. For example, up to 24, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? 4,14,24: that's 3 times. Using the formula: (24 + 1)/10 = 25/10 = 2.5, floor is 2, but that's not matching. Hmm, maybe my formula is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= d, else (N // 10). Wait, let me think again. For units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 488 where the units digit is 4. The largest such number is 484. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place, the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so let's see: 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th term, so 49 times. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place? Wait, but 488 is included, so for 4's, the last units digit is 484, which is 484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's also 49 numbers. So, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, from 40-49, which is 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times for 4 in the tens place. Now, for 8 in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. So, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, let's check the hundreds place. For 4, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For 8, the hundreds digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's sum up the counts for each digit position. For 4: Units place:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each step again. **Units place:** For 4's, from 4,14,...,484: as we saw earlier, that's 49 numbers. For 8's, from 8,18,...,488: also 49 numbers. So, units place is correct. **Tens place:** For 4's, we have 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. 4*10 +9=49. Correct. **Hundreds place:** 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's: none, so 0. Correct. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me just check if I considered all possible cases. For example, in the hundreds place, I only have 4's from 400-488, which is correct. For the tens place, I correctly accounted for the partial block in 480-488 for 8's. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - **Count of '4's:** From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Count of '8's:** From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence also has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **Count of '4's:** Found in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Count of '8's:** Found in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last block has 9 terms, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **Count of '4's:** From 400-488, totaling 89.\n   - **Count of '8's:** None, as the book doesn't reach page 800.\n\nSumming these:\n- **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Hmm, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10 numbers) plus any extra. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th decade ends at 480, and 481-488 are the remaining 8 pages. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the digit 4 appears 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades. So, 48 times in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra 8 in the units place? Let's see: 488 is the last page. The units digit is 8, so yes, it's included. So, from 1 to 488, the units place 8 appears 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, contributing 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 times. So, 8 appears 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 4 (which is the first occurrence). So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is 484, so let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (pages 40-49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the pages 400-488. Now, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 *10 =40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 380-389 is within 488. Yes, 389 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 +40=89. So, 89 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -89 (8's) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, correct? From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is 49. Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 49, correct, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. Tens place: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each 10, so 40. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Wait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 99 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 488 as a page, but does 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 400-something, so the hundreds digit is 4. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute because 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 89 8's. Therefore, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 4 is the 4th number. Hmm, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so in 488 numbers, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last set is 481-488. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets) plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is less than 490, so in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times (each 10 numbers), so 48 times, but in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's an extra 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 (from the full sets) + 1 (from the partial set) = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Each full set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, but the last one only contributes 9 (480-488). So, let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount that. For the tens place of 4's, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct. For the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (48 from full decades and 1 from 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50 (five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (4 full decades and 9 from 480-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. Let's calculate how many full groups of 100 there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit, which is 4. So each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, starting at 8, each step is 10. How many terms? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. Each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. For the 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. As calculated, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences (pages go up to 488).\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong because when you count from 4 to 484 with a step of 10, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48.4 + 1, but that's 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places as well. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges exist. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of a full set of 10, we have 9. So, how many full sets are there? Up to 380-389, that's four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the partial set from 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 4 (400-488) or less. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book stops at 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484.

Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. The first four are full sets, each 10 numbers: 4*10=40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total 40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488. So 0. Correct. So total 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range. That adds one more 4 in the units place, making it 49 times. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48. But 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last 4 in the units place before that. So, actually, it's 48 times, not 49. Because 488 is beyond 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, I think it's 48 times. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 times? Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count how many blocks: From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 98 8's. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rceil = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks and 9 for the last (480-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. Wait, that seems different. Let me confirm: from 4 to 484, how many numbers with 4 in units place? Each ten has one, so from 1-10: 4, 14, 24,...,484. The total number is 484 divided by 10, which is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens, but then the last number is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many such sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but it includes 440-449. So, how many hundreds? Let's see: 0-99: 40-49, that's one set. 100-199: another. 200-299: another. 300-399: another. 400-488: does it include another set? Yes, 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in tens place is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in this case, instead of 10, it's 9. So, total sets: 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, total in tens place is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 488 is beyond 389, but the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the 480-488 would have 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). Wait, so that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm seeing 49. Wait, let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in numbers where the tens place is 8. So, for each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the total number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 full sets (each contributing 10) and one partial set contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Number of full ranges: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers.  \n   Partial range (480-488): 9 numbers.  \n   Total:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences where 4 is in the hundreds place.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's 49. Hmm, but let me double-check. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 at most. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.

Let's calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (pages 40-49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50 (since 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488 inclusive)\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens: Let's recount. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8's, I have 49, but let me check 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for the tens place, from 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 pages, so 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the last range is 440-449, which is fully within 488, so that's 10 numbers, making it 5 ranges, each 10, so 50.\n\nYes, so the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), not 10, because 489 would be the next, but 488 is the end. So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, is there any overlap or double-counting? I don't think so because in the hundreds place, we're only counting the 4 in the hundreds digit, and in the tens place, we're counting the 4 in the tens digit, which are different digits. Similarly, in the units place, it's the units digit. So, each digit is counted separately. So, the total seems correct. Similarly, for the 8's, in the tens place, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Ranges: 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, last range contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers from 800-899 exist.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but when I count from 4 to 484 with a step of 10, how many numbers do I have? Let me see: from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is the 49th term (since 4 is the first term), maybe it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th term starting from 4. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be up to 449, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, in the hundreds place, if we go beyond 400, like 440-449, does that affect the count? Wait, 440 is in the 400s, so yes, that's valid. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. But in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book stops at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, each 10 numbers contribute 10 times, but here, 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place, the 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place for 9 numbers. So, how many ranges are there? Let me see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10\n180-189: 10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\n\nYes, that's 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place has 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nSo, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I counted 4's, I got 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place. When I have 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. So, 4 full tens ranges (80-89, etc.) and one partial with 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, as before. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, 4's: 188, 8's:98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check the 4's again:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nYes, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The tens place for 4's: ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is partial, so 4 full and 1 partial, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 + (48-1)*10 = 484. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, units place gives 48 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, there's one block (40-49), which has 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, another block (140-149), another 10. Similarly, 200-299 has 240-249, another 10, and 300-399 has 340-349, another 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total blocks are 5, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these blocks. In 1-99, 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, 180-189, another 10. 200-299, 280-289, another 10. 300-399, 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total blocks: first four blocks each have 10, and the last one has 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last (480-488) has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th set plus the 4th number in the 48th set. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra numbers. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (481-490), we have 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, but 484 is within this decade, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Wait, but actually, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's calculate it as floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last digit is 4 or higher, but since 488 ends with 8, which is higher than 4, does that mean we add 1? Wait, no, because the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1-480, there are 48 occurrences, and from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. In the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1-488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last digit is 8 or higher, but since 488 ends with 8, which is exactly 8, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, except the last one which only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488) have 8 in the tens place? Wait no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, numbers 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9, not 10. So, yes, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, 0 in hundreds, so 98 total 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th decade (480-489), we have 488, which is the 8th number, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I have 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers give one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, the count would be the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) / 10, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus 1 if the units digit of N is greater than or equal to d. So, for 4 in units place up to 488: The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades). In each decade, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 decades would give 48 fours. Then, we have the remaining 8 pages (481-488). In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check that again because 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, similar to the 4's, but let's count them. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The number of such numbers is the number of complete decades plus any extra in the incomplete decade. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total:98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For the 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49. Wait, but in the tens place, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. The ranges are: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Now, the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all 9, so 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49). So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades (480 numbers) contributing 48 fours, plus one more at 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 fours.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades contributing 48 eights, plus one more at 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 eights. There are 4 such full ranges, contributing 40 eights. The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Total tens place eights = 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 48 * 10 = 480, so 480 + 4 = 484. That makes sense. So, 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. That would be numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 numbers, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, because 8, 18, ..., 488: each ten contributes one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, how many tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the 49th ten would be 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so 488 is included. So, 48 full tens would give 48 8's, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first. Wait, no, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., up to 488 (49th). Because 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u21d2 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u21d2 n-1 \u2264 48 \u21d2 n \u2264 49. So, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is how many? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding these up: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10=20, 20+10=30, 30+10=40, 40+9=49. So, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's was 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, every 10th number adds one. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 for the starting number, so 49 times. Hmm, maybe that's a better way. Alternatively, since the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (since 488 / 10 = 48.8) and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each full decade, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 is the first, then each subsequent hundred. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within the range, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. There are 4 such full ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each gives 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the range 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the 8 is present in all these 9 numbers. So, adding 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 800-899 would be needed for hundreds digit 8, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full ranges (40) and 9, totaling 49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I thought maybe 90 seems too high. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89 is right. Similarly, 50 in the tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. So, 188 4's and 98 8's. The difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (48 full decades + 1 extra in 481-488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (48 full decades + 1 extra in 481-488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Full ranges contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. But actually, from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times? Wait, let me think again. The first 4 is at 4, which is the 4th number. Then every 10 numbers after that, so 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. Wait, no, in the tens place, 4 can be in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but we stop at 488. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n- 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\nBut wait, in 400-488, the tens place can be 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, when we're in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So total for tens place is 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me confirm. From 0-99: 40-49: 10.\nFrom 100-199: 140-149: 10.\nFrom 200-299: 240-249: 10.\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10.\nFrom 400-488: 440-449: 10.\nSo that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 in total. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The hundreds place is only for numbers 100 and above. So, for the hundreds place, the 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9).\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. As calculated, 49 times. That seems right because from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, which gives 49 numbers.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). So, 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, ((488-8)/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 isn't in the book. So, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but when considering the hundreds digit, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, I considered 40-49,140-149, etc., each contributing 10, and there are 5 such sets, so 50. That seems right.\n\nSame for units place of 4's: 49.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So, starting at 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think: the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. So, yes, that's 49. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. And then 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only looking at the hundreds digit being 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4 ranges with 10 each, and one with 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 48, that's 49 numbers. Wait, no, because 4 is the first, then every 10. So, 484 is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since we start at 4, which is the 1st, the count should be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Hmm, but wait, 484 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, where 4 is in the tens digit. These numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't count those. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. We're interested in when the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's from 400-488. Now, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, then every 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's calculate how many terms there are. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. These numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. Let's count how many blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9. So, total 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8, so numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the hundreds place for 4's is 89, but for 8's, it's 0. So, that's a big difference there. Let me make sure I didn't overcount the 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 50 times. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place is 49, which is correct because from 8, 18, ..., 488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place is 49 because 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899 \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, does 484 count as one? Let me check. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so yes, that's the 48th time. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, there are 187 4's printed. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 times. Wait, because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, from 8 to 488, how many? Let's see, 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in the 480-488 range. So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, let me check. Wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 187: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:187-98=89. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, for each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total number of blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each block, so 48 times. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. The highest range would be 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many such ranges? Let's count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges are within 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, the range 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them (480-488). So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except the last one which contributes 9. So, how many full ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again: for the tens place, each range is 10 numbers, except the last one if it's cut short. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4, but not 8. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of it as (488 / 10) = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then the 49th is at 484. So, 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, yes, 49 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in the 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. Wait, 400-449 is within 488, but 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So, how many blocks? 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. How many such blocks? From 0 to 488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, 89 eights in total. Now, the difference is 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.

So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last page, so 484 is included, so that would be correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but in the last range, 440-449, does that go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is within the book, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's the last page. So, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for 8's, the hundreds place is 0 because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no page numbers start with 8. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.  \n   - There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.  \n   - First four ranges contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and 480-488 contributes 9: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Count: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. Hmm, but actually, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think differently. For each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, actually, it's 48 complete sets (each giving one 4) plus one more in the incomplete set, making it 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, each full decade contributes one 4, so 48, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, in the last block, 440-449, is that entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each full set of 10 contributes one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, each block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. So, how many full blocks are there? From 0-399, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, the 8's: Units place: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks of 10 numbers each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 49, correct because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets plus one more in the last partial set, making 49. Hundreds place: 89 fours from 400-488 inclusive. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 188 fours total. Now, for the 8's: Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Hundreds place: 0, correct. So, 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems to check out. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is up to 489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, the ranges are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, each of the first four ranges has 10, and the last has 9. So, total in tens place is 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. That's 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. However, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488.

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Hmm, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, actually, each hundred block has a 40-49 block. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), does the tens digit 8 occur? Yes, 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's are 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit. 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48, so 48 numbers. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 480 / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 8's, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, so the answer would be 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: each hundred has a 40-49, so 10 numbers per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens place 4's would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one, so how many? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 numbers. Wait, but 48*10=480, so 480 +4=484, so yes, 48 numbers. So, 48 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds, total 187. For 8's: units place, from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so how many? (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these is 10 numbers, except the last one in 400-488, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, yes, the difference is 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range (except the last) contributes 10 occurrences; the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{89}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, and so on up to 440-449. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 times in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Wait, but 80-89 is within 1-488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 8 appears 89 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.
