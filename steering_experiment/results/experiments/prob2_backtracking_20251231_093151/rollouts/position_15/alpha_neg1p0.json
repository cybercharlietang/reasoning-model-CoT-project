    "text": " So, there are 48 instances where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is indeed the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 instances of the digit 4. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's minus number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 89 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 4 as the first. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (Last - First)/Step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's calculate each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages, which is 488, and for each group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should check with smaller numbers. Let's say from 1 to 20: 4,14,24. That's 3 times, which is 20/10 = 2, but wait, actually 20/10 is 2, but there are 3 numbers (4,14,24). Wait, so maybe it's (n // 10) + 1 if the last number is beyond a multiple of 10. Hmm, perhaps I should adjust my approach. Alternatively, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10). So, for N=488, floor(488/10)=48. So, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it would be the same: floor(488/10)=48. But wait, let me confirm with N=20: floor(20/10)=2, but there are 3 instances (8,18,28). Wait, that's a problem. So, maybe the formula isn't exactly floor(N/10). Alternatively, perhaps it's floor((N + 1)/10). Let me check: for N=20, (20+1)/10=2.1, floor is 2, but we have 3 instances. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe the correct formula is floor((N - d)/10) + 1, where d is the digit. So, for d=4, floor((488 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10) +1 =48 +1=49. Wait, that might make sense because from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, and 484 is the 48th group, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times. Similarly, for 8, floor((488 -8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place? But wait, earlier I thought 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but with the formula, it's 49. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify: for units digit, the number of times digit d appears from 1 to N is equal to floor((N - d)/10) +1, provided d <= N. So, for d=4 and N=488, it's floor((488-4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. Similarly, for d=8, floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Wait, but let me check with a smaller N, say N=14. For d=4, units place: 4,14. So, 2 times. Using the formula: floor((14-4)/10)+1= floor(10/10)+1=1+1=2. Correct. For d=8, N=14: only 8. So, 1 time. Using formula: floor((14-8)/10)+1= floor(6/10)+1=0+1=1. Correct. So, the formula works. So, for units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 ranges \u00d710 numbers=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189:10.\n- 280-289:10.\n- 380-389:10.\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 4 or lower. Wait, no, 488 is 4 in the hundreds place, so 8 can't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each. That seems correct because from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, except for the last digit if it's beyond a multiple of 10. Wait, but earlier I used the formula and got 49 for both, but let me think again. For example, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Similarly, 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nTens place: For 4, it's 5 ranges (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. For 8, it's 4 full ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and a partial range 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 50 vs 49, so 4 appears once more in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: For 4, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. For 8, it's zero because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit is 4 only. So, 89 vs 0.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's. 49+49+0=98 for 8's. 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits printed and see if this makes sense, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about each digit position separately again.\n\nWait, another way: for each position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: floor((488 -4)/10) +1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49\n- 8's: floor((488 -8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: the tens digit is 4 in numbers from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449.\n\nEach block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Since 488 is less than 500, we have:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-489: but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 400-488: that's 89 numbers.\n\nFor 8's: no numbers, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur every 10 numbers, starting from 4. The count is calculated as floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, occur every 10 numbers, starting from 8. The count is also 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appear in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 numbers. Total = 50.\n   - **8's:** Appear in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers). Total = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appear from 400 to 488, totaling 89 numbers.\n   - **8's:** Do not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th number, right? Because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so yes, 48 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but from 400-488, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as one? Yes, because 488 is the 48th occurrence in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me check each range: - From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. - From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. - From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. - From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. Correct. 187-97=90. That seems right. I think I did this correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers. Totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, there are 48 instances where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times, not 48. Because when you include both the first and last term, you add 1. So, 484 is the 49th term. Let me correct that: units place for 4's is 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place as well. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the counts for each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, does 380-389 go beyond 488? No, because 389 is less than 488. So, yes, all 40 numbers are included. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 800 is beyond 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for each place: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 times. So, the digit 8 appears 89 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so yes, there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449. Does 449 exceed 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all these ranges are valid. So, 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. Now, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's calculate how many numbers that is. 488 minus 400 plus 1 (since both endpoints are included) gives 89 numbers. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 gives 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8) / 10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be a full range, but since the book ends at 488, the last range is only up to 488. So, let's count each range. From 80-89: that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. And 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me add again: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) = 40, plus 9 (480-488) = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 +50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 +49 is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is within 488. And for 8's in the tens place, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that adds up correctly. Let me just check the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, the total fours are 187, eights are 98, difference is 89. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10). From 201-300: 240-249 (10). From 301-400: 340-349 (10). From 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 block of 9 (from 401-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which is correct? Let me list some: 4 is the first, then 14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, actually, units place has 49 4's, not 48. So I made a mistake earlier. Similarly, for tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Wait, that's different from before. So, I think I miscalculated the units place earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4's: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, for 8's: Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, now I'm getting 90. Hmm, this is conflicting with my earlier calculation. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider each digit place separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear. For units place: For 4's: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in units place. Similarly, for 8's: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in units place. For tens place: For 4's: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each: 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in tens place. For 8's: Tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in tens place. Hundreds place: For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 4's. For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 would be 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's. Now, adding up: 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=49+50=99+89=188. 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full numbers, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times? Wait, no, because from 8 to 488, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, starting at 8 (1st), 18 (2nd), ..., 488 (49th). Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the 49th multiple. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 within 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th set starts at 480, which is 480-488, so 488 is the last number. So, 48 complete sets plus one more, making it 49. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the last number is >= the digit. Wait, let me check: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so floor(48.8) = 48. Then, check if the last number (488) has an 8 in the units place. Yes, it does, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place, except possibly the last block. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last partial block. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because 480-489 would be a full block, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus the 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the 4's were 187 and 8's were 98, which would make the difference 89. But let me double-check my counting for 8's. Wait, in the units place, I had 49, and in the tens place, 49, so total 98. Hmm, but let me think again. When counting the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 8 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th set starts at 480, which includes 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct. For the tens place, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, total 49 in the tens place. So, 49 + 49 = 98 for 8's. Now, for 4's, I had 187, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me check my 4's count again. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 = 187. That seems correct. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9, so 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, yes, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. Hmm, actually, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include 484? Yes, 484 is within 488, so the 48th occurrence is at 484. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 0-99, that's 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199: 140-149: another 10. 200-299: 240-249: another 10. 300-399: 340-349: another 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's 10 more. So, total in the tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50. Wait, but let me check the last block. 400-488: does 440-449 fall within this? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place. These occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm. The first four ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the number of 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, so the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 full hundreds (0-399) each have 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 400-488, so 49. That's correct. And units place: 48 times. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers where the units digit is 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last range is 440-449, which is also 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is 4*10 + 0 to 4*10 + 9), then 140-149 (14*10), etc. Wait, maybe a better way is to see how many hundreds are there. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But in the tens place, the 4 can occur in each hundred block. So, for each hundred, there's a 40-49 block. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's: 48 + 50 +89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. So 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) +1. Let's compute that: (480)/10=48, so 48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's see. Each hundred block has an 80-89 range. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 -480 +1=9). So, how many 8's in the tens place? 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that seems correct. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last one. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times because when you include both endpoints, you add 1. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let's see how many blocks of 100 there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is a bit different. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, all numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, the last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, and then 480-489 would be next, but 488 is the last page. So, let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is included, but 489 is beyond the book's pages). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So, total in tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check if 484 is within the range. Yes, 484 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is less than 488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers are there? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count the number of 4's in each digit position. So, in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places:\n\nUnits: 48\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking each digit position.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 48*10=480, so 480 +8=488, which is included. So, that's 49 occurrences? Wait, because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's set that equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges exist within 1-488.\n\n- 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-489: but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers.\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 is 10.\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 is 10.\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 is 10.\nFrom 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 49\nHundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49 in units and 49 in tens, so 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 187 seems high for 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, 484 is the last term. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 occurrences in units place, not 48. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate units place for 4's:\n\nFrom 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and how many such ranges?\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49: 10\nFrom 100-199:140-149:10\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10 (since 449 is less than 488)\nSo, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 49+50+89=188, but I initially thought 48+50+89=187. So, I had an error there. So, correct total 4's is 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. So, I think I had an off-by-one error earlier.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49\nTens place for 4's:50\nHundreds place for 4's:89\nTotal 4's:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49\nTens place for 8's:49\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nWait, but from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49 numbers.\n\nTens place for 4's:50 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last range is only up to 488, so the tens digit in 400-488 can be 4 only up to 449. Let me check: 400-449 is 50 numbers, but since we're only considering the tens digit as 4, it's 10 numbers each for each hundred. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full tens, which gives 48 numbers. But wait, 48*10 = 480, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because starting from 8 as the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many terms? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it doesn't reach 489. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " But wait, does 488 count? No, because we're only considering the units place, and 488 ends with an 8, not a 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, actually, let me check that. The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10). So, for N=488, floor(488/10)=48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which is every number from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89. Wait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Using the same formula: floor(488/10)=48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, does that mean 49 times? Wait, let's think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so actually, it's the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so it's the 48th 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, let me correct that. The first four blocks (0-399) each have 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 40+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:97. The difference is 187-97=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: floor(488/10)=48. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's: 48+50+89=187. Now, 8's: Units place: floor(488/10)=48. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's:48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so actually, it's 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 numbers. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 488th page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 numbers. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of this. Let me count these blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 8 appears 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in page numbers up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count? Let me check. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, meaning there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. But wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, it should be included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is also 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th number? Wait, no, because 8, 18, ..., 488 is every 10 numbers starting at 8. So, the count is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49? Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want the largest n such that 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. Hmm, so that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be pages like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each range of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so yes. So, total 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the 4's: units place. I had 48 numbers. Wait, earlier I thought 484 is the last one, which is correct. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because from 4 to 484, inclusive, every 10 numbers, so the count is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place for 4 is 49, not 48. That changes things. Similarly, for the tens place, I had 50. Let me check that again. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers. How many such ranges? From 0-99: 40-49 (10). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, total 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, earlier I thought 48 +50 +89=187, but now it's 49+50+89=188. So, I had an error in the units place count for 4's. It should be 49, not 48. Similarly, let's check the 8's count. Units place: from 8,18,...,488. As I thought earlier, that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, now, 4's: 188, 8's:98. Difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. So, I need to correct that. Let me summarize: 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me recount the 4's units place. From 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, units place for 4 is 49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484 - 4}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 8}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, so it's 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? Let's see: the first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if there are more sets beyond that. The next set would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we stop at 440-449. So, 5 sets, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such sets. Each set has 10 numbers. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. The next set would be 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the sets are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I missed something. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many? (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. So, 4's total 188. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, the last has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 8's total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Oh, I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 blocks are fully included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489 is part of the book since it goes up to 488. So, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's adjust. So, normally, each block is 10 numbers, but the last block is only 9. So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full blocks (40 numbers) and 9 in the last partial block. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. Yes. And for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) up to 380-389, which is 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for 8's: same as 4's, 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, but let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time, the count is actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are up to 488. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last incomplete group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, for the tens place, the number of 4's is 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but I'm only supposed to count the digit 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then in the last group (481-488), the units digit is 8, so that's one more, totaling 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges fit into 488. From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100, so there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears once per hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 480-488 would have the tens digit 8, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, but actually, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has tens digit 8, etc., up to 488. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 480, the tens digit is 8, in 481 it's 8, ..., up to 489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 4 (from the first four hundreds) times 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but that can't be right because each range like 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 4 ranges would be 40, and then in 480-488, it's 9 more, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, in the range 481-488, 484 is included, adding one more, totaling 49. However, upon re-evaluation, since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, totaling 48. But considering 484 is within the range, the correct count is 49. However, upon further reflection, the correct method is to calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 numbers. However, in the range 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, in the range 481-488, 488 is included, adding one more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers. Additionally, in the range 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 instances of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, and 300-399: 340-349. Then, from 400-488: 440-449 is another block. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. Let me count the number of blocks: 1-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1 block, 200-299: 1 block, 300-399: 1 block, 400-488: 1 block. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the last block, 440-449, the upper limit is 488, so does that affect the count? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers from 440-449 are included. So, 5 blocks *10=50. So, 50 instances of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 instances. Now, adding up all the instances of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 48*10=480, so 488 is 488-480=8, so 488 is included. So, 48 instances. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included in the units place 8's. So, 48 instances. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 instances where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another block (10 numbers). Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, and 300-399: 380-389. Then, 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the block would have started at 480, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place 8's in the 400-488 block are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count the blocks: 1-99: 10 numbers, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 instances of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 instances. Now, adding up all the instances of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so actually, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we take the floor of that, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms, it's an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. So I think my initial thought was wrong. It should be 49 times because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49: that's one block, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is fine because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the arithmetic sequence: first term 8, last term 488, common difference 10. Number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears.

Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last page is 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, how many times? Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so 488 is included. So, 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, but wait, actually, from 8 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 in 488. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, which is the 8th number. Then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (488 - 8) = 480, 480 /10 = 48, so 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 48. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check with smaller numbers. For example, from 1 to 88, how many 8's in the units place? 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88. That's 9 numbers, which is 88/10 = 8.8, floor to 8, but then plus 1? Wait, no, from 8 to 88, the first is 8 (1), then every 10, so 8,18,28,...,88. That's (88 -8)/10 +1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 =9. So, yes, the formula is correct. So, applying that to 488: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets and the partial set. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488). So, the tens place 8's are: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 187, total 8's are 98. So, 187 -98=89. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's in hundreds place were 89, but 8's in tens place were 49, and 4's in units were 48, etc. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back to counting 4's. 1. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in the units place. Wait, earlier I thought 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, which is correct? Let me take a small example. From 1 to 24, how many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24: that's 3 numbers. Using the formula: (24-4)/10 +1= (20)/10 +1=2+1=3. Correct. So, in the case of 488, (488-4)/10 +1=484/10 +1=48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part? Wait, no, the formula should be ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct, 49 4's in the units place. I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, that's 49. 2. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, earlier I thought 187, but now it's 188. Let me check again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of 4's units place. Let me confirm again. For units place of 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49. So, units place:49. Tens place:5 sets, 50. Hundreds place:89. So, 49+50=99, +89=188. So, total 4's:188. 8's: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct. So, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the 8's in the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Units place:49, so total 8's:98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but in the initial problem, the user wrote \"the first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488.\" So, page 488 is included. So, in the units place for 4's, 484 is included, which is correct. So, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is in the first hundred (1-100), then in 140-149 (second hundred), 240-249 (third hundred), and 340-349 (fourth hundred). Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many sets? Let me count: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 for all these numbers, so that's correct. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, so 8 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place, each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct count for the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. There are four complete sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (40-49). So, for the first four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many complete hundreds we have. Up to 380-389 is within 300-399, and then 480-489 would be in 400-488, but 488 is the last page. So, for each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within the 488-page limit. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 48*10 + 8. So, the count is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. That's a total of 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but let me check if 380-389 is within 488. Yes, 389 is less than 488, so it's included. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 187 - 89 is 98, but let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49 + 40 = 89. So, 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. Let me check again. The units place for 8's: starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, and 380-389 is 10. That's 4 ranges, each 10, so 40. So, 40 in the tens place. So, total 89. So, 187 - 89 = 98. Wait, but I thought maybe 98 is the answer, but I'm not sure if I missed something. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should check the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page 800 or above, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 98. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place for 4's, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, but does each of those numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 400-488 all start with 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right, and the answer is 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, there are 48 fours in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. Oh, so there are actually 49 fours in the units place. I think I made a mistake earlier by just taking the integer part. Let me correct that. So, the number of fours in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), and so on up to 440-449. Let's see how many full decades we have. The first is 40-49, then each subsequent hundred adds another 10. So, from 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method as before: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489 is another set, but since our book only goes up to 488, we have to check how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, total eights in the tens place would be 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th number, right? Because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so yes, 48 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. Let me count the ranges: 40-49 is one range, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. To find how many such numbers there are, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number because 8 \u00d7 61 = 488. Wait, no, actually, from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th number because 8 \u00d7 61 = 488, but 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place? Wait, no, because 8, 18, 28,..., 488. So, starting from 8 as the first, each step of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, right, because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. I think I made a mistake earlier by just taking the integer part. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one, 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 4's. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but when I considered the hundreds place, I got 89. Let me confirm units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). So, 484 -4 = 10*(n-1) \u2192 480 =10*(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. Wait, so that's 49 times. Did I make a mistake earlier? I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. So, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me check: 484 is the last one, which is 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting at 4, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 484 is 480 +4, which is 48*10 +4, so n=49. So, units place for 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. Let me recalculate.\n\nUnits:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier, thinking it was 187. So, 4's are 188.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\nUnits place:49, as we saw earlier.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90. Earlier I thought 89, but now it's 90. Hmm, seems like I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the units place earlier.\n\nLet me go through again:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 +10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192n-1=48\u2192n=49. So, 49 4's in units.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nHundreds place:400-488:488-400+1=89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8+10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480\u2192n-1=48\u2192n=49. So, 49 8's.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 89, but now it's 90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the 4's tens place, 440-449: that's 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So, yes, 10 numbers.\n\nIn the 8's tens place, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, so 8+1=9).\n\nSo, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, 8's:49+49=98.\n\n4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is included, right? Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for numbers 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, for the tens place, each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's calculate how many full hundreds we have: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, for each hundred except the last one (400-488), there are 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. For the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 hundreds (including the partial one), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, 1-99: tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let me check how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. For each hundred block: 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the 400-488 block, there are 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, adding up: 4 blocks (1-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is in 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 187. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount or undercount in any digit place. Let me go through each digit place again. **4's in units place:** From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which one is correct? Let me list a few: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 48; it should be 49. Hmm, so that changes things. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for the 8's in units place, I had 49, which seems correct because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 8's in units place. So, if I correct the 4's in units place to 49, then the total 4's would be: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, 8's total is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's earlier. Let me confirm again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, the last at 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times. So, I had initially thought 48, but it's actually 49. So, correcting that, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. The number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. But earlier, I thought the difference was 89. So, which is correct? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the tens place. Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. That seems correct. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct difference is 90. I think I made a mistake in my initial count of the 4's in the units place, thinking it was 48 instead of 49. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of terms = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each hundred contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such hundreds (including the partial 400-488).  \n   Total = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   Total = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of terms = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Each hundred contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9.  \n   Total = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers in the 800-899 range, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The total count is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49, not 48. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to include the starting number, so 48 +1 =49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens place can be 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book only has 488 pages, 449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. The count is floor((488 -8)/10) +1 = floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, 80-89 is within 1-488, so yes, all included. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, total 89 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -89=99.

    "text": " But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I count from 4 to 484 in steps of 10, the number of terms is actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me compute that: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: the first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, starting at 8, each step is +10. How many terms? Let's compute (488 - 8)/10 +1. (488-8)=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also include 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, each range is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's count the ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full ranges of 10, and one partial range of 9. So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. Wait, but let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389 each have 10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " But wait, I think I should check if 488 is included. Since 484 is the last one before 488, it's okay. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49, that's one block. Then, each subsequent hundred (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s) has another block. Let's count: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, but wait, that's not the right way. Actually, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, no, 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are: 80-89 (1st), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th). The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but I'm considering the tens place. So, each full block contributes 10 8's, but the last block might not be complete. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers \u2192 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 8's. So total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89 \u2192 total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0 \u2192 total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50. Correct. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48\u00d710 +4, so 48 numbers. Correct. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89.

    "text": " But wait, let me check that. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so maybe 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term because starting from 4, each step is +10. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). Wait, but for the tens place, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 once. So, for 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). For 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). For 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). For 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). For 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 goes up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So total in tens place is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check again. For 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four sets have 10 numbers each, and the last set has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count these. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, not 499, so the last set is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 480-488 is part of the next hundred. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes the 400s. Let me correct that. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: 10 numbers. From 240-249: 10 numbers. From 340-349: 10 numbers. From 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 0-8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but let me check again because 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, how many times? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49 = 392, but wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: 10 numbers. From 280-289: 10 numbers. From 380-389: 10 numbers. From 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total for the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) which is 40, plus the 480-488 which is 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the 800s, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9 =49. So, total 8's: 48 +49=97. So, now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 -97=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a lot. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The last number is 484, which is 4 + 48*10=484. So, 48 numbers. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. That seems correct. Now, for the 8's. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? The last one is 488, which is 488=8*61, but in terms of units digit, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, so 48 occurrences. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me check the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the 8's, the hundreds place is zero because we don't reach 800. So, yes, 97. So, the difference is 90. But let me think again: when counting the units digit for 4's, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers, correct. For the tens digit, 40-49 is 10, then each hundred block up to 400-499 would have another 10, but since we stop at 488, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs only up to 449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, 50. So, 48+50+89=187. For the 8's, units digit: 48, tens digit:49, so 97. So, 187-97=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of those numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, 89. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units:48, tens:49, so 97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers in the 800s).\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times. Hmm, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. Wait, 0 would be for the first 99 numbers, but the tens place can be 4 in the first block (40-49), then in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, and each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, the last block would be 380-389, since 480-489 is beyond 488, but 380-389 is within 488. So, how many blocks? 40-49 is 40s, but for 8 in tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. That's 4 blocks, so 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each step is 10, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me confirm: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the tens place contributions are: 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) totaling 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 (since we include both endpoints) gives 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by N divided by 10, taking the integer part, and then adding 1 if the digit is present in the units place of N. So, for 488, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449. So, how many such sets are there? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n- 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\n\nSo that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. So, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? Let's compute: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But since 488 is included, we add 1. So, 48 +1 =49. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 480 is included and 488 is the last). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, the first four sets are complete, each contributing 10 8's, and the last set is incomplete, contributing 9 8's. So, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, so total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 would be the last one, and since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, that's 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 because both ends are included. Wait, actually, when I count how many numbers, it's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The first number is 8, which is the 1st occurrence, then 18 is the 2nd, and so on. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. Each of these ranges (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: 48 numbers. That seems correct because 484 is the last one, so 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full.\n\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers, correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. When I count from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers is that? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, from 4 to 484, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49? Wait, wait, that's conflicting with my earlier count. Wait, I thought units place for 4's was 48, but according to this formula, it should be 49.\n\nWait, let me check. The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, how many numbers? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said units place for 4's was 48; it's actually 49. Hmm, that changes things.\n\nSo, let me correct that:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now using the formula, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list some numbers. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10:\n\n4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? Let's see, 484 is 4 + 10*(n-1). So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 numbers. So, my initial count was wrong; it's 49, not 48.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I made a mistake earlier by one in the units place for 4's. So, the correct answer should be 90, not 89.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50 (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the initial mistake was in the units place for 4's, which I corrected to 49 instead of 48. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place for 4's, it's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49 numbers, as per the formula.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49 numbers.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, I need to make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach, like considering each digit position separately and calculating the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor a 488-page book, page numbers are from 001 to 488, but leading zeros don't count, so maybe it's better to think in terms of 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\nBut perhaps a more systematic way is to consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nLet's start with the units place for 4:\n\n- For each full set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, contributing 48*1=48. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full sets (8,18,...,488). Wait, 488 is included, so 48 full sets plus the last one? Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence, as we saw earlier. So, 49.\n\nNow, tens place for 4:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, but let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 10 times (40-49)\n- 100-199: 10 times (140-149)\n- 200-299: 10 times (240-249)\n- 300-399: 10 times (340-349)\n- 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\n- 0-99: 10 times (80-89)\n- 100-199:10 times (180-189)\n- 200-299:10 times (280-289)\n- 300-399:10 times (380-389)\n- 400-488: the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I made a mistake initially by miscalculating the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. After correcting that, the total number of 4's becomes 188, and the difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each full set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has a set where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 numbers. Wait, no, because 400-488 is the fifth block, but the tens digit being 4 occurs only once in that block, from 440-449. So, actually, it's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does the tens digit 4 occur 10 times there? Yes, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's included. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 such numbers. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the last block, only 9 numbers have 8 in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks with 10 numbers each (from 1-399) and one block with 9 numbers (400-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the number 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, the digit 8 appears 97 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again. Starting with 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:48, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: in each hundred block, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each gives 10 numbers. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place: in each hundred block up to 300-399, there are 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. But in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. So, 48+49=97 for 8's. So, the difference is 187-97=90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any overlap or did I miss something? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, I think I should check if 484 is the last one. 484 is indeed the last page number where 4 appears in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but when I think about it, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is given by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= d, else (N // 10). So, for 4 in units place up to 488: 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488 % 10 = 8 >=4, so it's 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, we have 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100, so for each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. So, in each of these hundreds, except maybe the last one, there's a full set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49:10 numbers. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 10 * 5? Wait, no, because 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but does it have a full 10 numbers? Let me check. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 0-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488) =50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That's in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with remainder 8, so the last number is 488. So, how many? The first is 8, then 18, up to 488. So, the count is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, using the formula: (N // 10) +1 if N %10 >=8. 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=8, so 48+1=49. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 10 there are where the tens digit is 8. Each hundred has one such set. So, from 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check that. From 0-99:80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 is correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 49, because the last set was 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, that seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check: 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8? Wait, no, 8*1=8, 8*2=18, ..., 8*49=392, but 488 is 8*61=488? Wait, that can't be. Wait, actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=8. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Wait, but let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the incomplete group, the last number is 488, which has a units digit of 8, so that's one more. So total units 8's:48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't reach 489. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 -480 +1=9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.
