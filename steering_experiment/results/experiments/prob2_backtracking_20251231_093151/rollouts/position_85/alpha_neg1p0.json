    "text": " Correct. So, yeah, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the tens place for 4's, does 440-449 include 10 numbers? Yes, 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, 484 is included, so that's 49 numbers. I think I've covered all cases. So, yeah, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1s):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1s):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s):** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s):** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. So, the total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. 4's are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** \n     - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):**\n     - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Total occurrences: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):**\n     - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total occurrences: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9.\n     - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total occurrences: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
