This gives:\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 Taking the integer part and adding 1 gives 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page).
