This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in numbers 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 4 to 484, there are (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), giving 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 8 to 488, there are (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, so total is 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The last is 484, which is 484=4 +10*(n-1). So, 484-4=480=10*(n-1), so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For the 8's: units place: from 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place.

Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So that's correct. So, 188 fours, 98 eights, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484-4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, from 8 to 488, same calculation: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place in 4's: each hundred block has 10 numbers, so 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. For tens place in 8's: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 0. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

Let me think about the tens place for 8's again. When I considered the tens place, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9, and the others are 10 each, so 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems right. Similarly, for the 4's, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but more carefully. For 4's: Units place: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms?

That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total:49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place:8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488.

    "text": " units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 50 fours. Units:49. So, total 188 fours. For 8's, units:49, tens:49. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I went up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. But wait, 484 is the last page, right? So, yes, 484 is included. Similarly, for 8's, the units place goes up to 488, which is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. For the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 98 eights total. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place for 4's? 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes. And in the tens place, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Units place:49. So, 188. For 8's, units and tens:49 each, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in tens and units, I might have missed something. Let me double-check the units place for 4's. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) =484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct.
