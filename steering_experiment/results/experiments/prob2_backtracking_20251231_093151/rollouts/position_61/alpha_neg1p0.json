In the hundreds place, 800-899 isn't in the book, so no 8's there. In the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which is 480-488, giving 9 numbers. So 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers.

Similarly, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, as I had 5 blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50.

Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. How many terms? (484 -4)/10 +1= 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's might have more, but no, 488 is the limit, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89.

Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems right. And the hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right.

So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but maybe that's correct. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many is that? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:8,18,...,488. 488 is 8 + 480, so 48 intervals, which makes 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units and tens each have 49, so 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, 4's: each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct. Units place: 49, which is correct because 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units and tens each have 49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does that include 400? Yes, because 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. For the tens place of 8's: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the total eights are 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the units place for 4's. When I counted units place, I went up to 484, which is 484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. Let me calculate that again. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place, that's correct. For the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419:1, ..., 440-449:4, 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So, in the tens place, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, that's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place? For 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. For 8's, the hundreds digit is never 8 because the book ends at 488, so 0. So, yes, 98 eights.

Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me think of another way to count the 4's and 8's. Alternatively, I can consider each digit place separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place. For 4's: Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 times. Tens place: Every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the hundreds place, 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Wait, but earlier I had 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing something. Wait, no, let me clarify. The tens place: For each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149:10. From 200-299:240-249:10. From 300-399:340-349:10. From 400-488:440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, that's correct. Similarly, units place fours: 49. Hundreds place fours: 89 (from 400-488). So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: same as before, 49. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except the last hundred. From 0-99:80-89:10. From 100-199:180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, 8's total:49+49=98. So, difference:188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

When I counted the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. For the units place, from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct.
