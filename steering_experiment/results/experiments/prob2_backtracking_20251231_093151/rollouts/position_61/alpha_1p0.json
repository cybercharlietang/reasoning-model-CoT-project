Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, for each hundred block, there's a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers.

I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except 480-488 which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 40-49,140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.

But in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)*10 + extra if last two digits >=80.\n\n488/100=4.88, floor is 4, so 4*10=40. In the last hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, which occurs from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, same result. So, I think 90 is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but when I think about it, the hundreds place contributes a lot more 4's than 8's. Since 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, whereas 8's in hundreds place don't exist here.

So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.

And for the 4's, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but in the tens place, the 4's in the tens digit occur in 40-49, which is in the first hundred, then 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the 400s.

    "text": " units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. Now, for the 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. And for 8's, the hundreds place is zero. So, yes, 90 seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit position separately and see if there's a pattern or formula. For example, in a number with n digits, the number of times a digit appears in a certain position can be calculated using a formula. But maybe that's overcomplicating it since I've already counted manually and got 90. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula to confirm. Let's see, for the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is given by: floor(N/10) + (1 if d <= (N mod 10) else 0). Wait, no, that's for the units place. Let me think again. For the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think for the units place: For each 10 numbers, the digit d appears once in the units place. So, for N=488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0). So, 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. That matches what I had before. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so 48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved. For the tens digit, the number of times d appears is floor((N // 100) * 10) + (if (N % 100) >= d*10 then 1 else 0) + (if (N % 100) >= (d+1)*10 then 1 else 0). Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of higher digits. Alternatively, for the tens place, the number of times d appears is: higher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\nif current > d:\n    count += (higher + 1) * 10\nelif current == d:\n    count += (higher + 1) * 10\n    count += lower + 1\nelse:\n    count += higher * 10\n\nWait, that might be a formula I can use. Let me try applying it for 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 =48%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nWe're looking for d=4.\n\nSince current=8 >4, so count += (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=50.\n\nBut wait, in reality, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nd=8\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=48%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 == d=8, so count += (higher +1)*10=5*10=50, and then add lower +1=8+1=9, so total 50+9=59? Wait, that doesn't match what I had before. Wait, earlier I counted 49 eights in the tens place. Hmm, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Wait, let's see. When current=8 and d=8, the formula says count += (higher +1)*10 + lower +1. So, higher=4, so (4+1)*10=50, plus lower+1=8+1=9, total 59. But earlier I thought it was 49. That's a discrepancy. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, earlier, for 8's in the tens place, I considered:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nThat's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 59. That's a problem. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts all the numbers from 0 to N, including leading zeros, but in reality, page numbers start at 1, so maybe the formula is counting numbers like 080-089 as valid, which they aren't. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, let me try to apply the formula correctly. The formula is for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 0 to N. But our page numbers start at 1, so maybe we need to adjust.\n\nWait, let me test the formula with a smaller number. Let's say N=89. How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times (80-89). According to the formula:\n\nhigher = 89//100=0\ncurrent=(89//10)%10=8\nlower=89%10=9\n\nd=8.\n\nSince current=8 == d=8, count += (0+1)*10=10, and count += lower +1=9+1=10. So total 20. But that's incorrect because from 0 to89, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So the formula is overcounting by 10. Hmm, that suggests the formula might not be directly applicable here. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is intended for numbers with leading zeros, so that all numbers are considered as three-digit numbers, which they aren't in this case. So, maybe it's better to stick with my initial counting method, which gave me 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let's try to apply the formula correctly. Let's take N=488.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=48%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nd=8.\n\nSince current >=d, we add (higher +1)*10=5*10=50, and if current >d, we add lower+1. But since current=d, we only add lower+1 if lower >=d? Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nif current > d:\n    count += (higher +1)*10\nelif current == d:\n    count += (higher +1)*10\n    count += lower +1\nelse:\n    count += higher *10\n\nWait, that would mean for current=8 and d=8, count +=5*10=50, and count +=lower +1=8+1=9, so total 59. But that's incorrect because from 0 to488, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 50 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 5 sets with 10,10,10,10,9, totaling 49. So, the formula is giving 59, which is higher than actual. So, perhaps the formula is not suitable here, or I'm misapplying it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula counts from 0 to N, but page numbers start at 1, so we need to subtract the cases where the number is less than 100, which might not have leading zeros. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with my initial counting, which gave me 49 eights in the tens place, leading to a total of 98 eights, and 188 fours, resulting in 90 more fours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recount the eights in the tens place more carefully.\n\nLet me list the ranges where the tens digit is 8:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the fours in the tens place, it's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo, the initial counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fours is 188, and the total number of eights is 98, so the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the formula gave me 59 for eights in the tens place, which contradicts my manual count. So, perhaps I should trust my manual count since it's more straightforward.\n\nYes, I think I'm confident that the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98, so the answer is 90 more fours.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\).\n\nTotal number of 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each range except the last contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: \\(188 - 98 = 90\\)\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens, so 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some, but no, the book only goes up to 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, yes, 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
