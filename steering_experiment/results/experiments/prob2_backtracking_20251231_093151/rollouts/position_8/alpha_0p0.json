    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider the one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I should count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the numbers from 40 to 49 will have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49), so that's 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, let me list them out. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 occurrences. But wait, in the 40-49 group, the units digit 4 is already counted in the tens place. So, do I count it again here? Hmm, I think I should because each digit position is counted separately. So, in the units place, for each ten's group, there's one 4, so 9 times. But wait, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 groups of 10. So, 9 occurrences in the units place. But wait, when the tens digit is 4, like 44, that's already counted in the tens place, but the units digit 4 is still a separate occurrence. So, yes, I should count it again. So, in the units place, there are 9 occurrences of 4. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nNow, let's move on to the three-digit page numbers, from 100 to 488. Here, each number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I'll need to count the number of 4's in each of these places. \n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for the hundreds place, the 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. Let's break this down. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I'll count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n- For 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n- For 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, 440-449 would be in this range, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. However, wait, 488 is the last page, so after 449, the next number is 450, but the tens digit is 5, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundreds group, I'll count how many times 4 appears in the units place. \n\n- For 100-199: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 occurrences.\n- For 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 occurrences.\n- For 400-488: The units digit can be 0-8, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. Wait, 400-488 includes up to 488, so the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: one-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers (1-9). The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99). Again, I'll count the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nTens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 such groups, so 9 occurrences. But wait, in the 80-89 group, the units digit 8 is already counted in the tens place, but I think I should still count it again here because it's a separate digit. So, 9 occurrences in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers (100-488). Again, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 can't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds group, count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8, so 480-488, but wait, the tens digit is 8, so numbers from 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundreds group, count how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n- 100-199: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: The units digit 8 appears at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 488.\n\nSo, total in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: one-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the three-digit counts because 78 seems a bit low. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me recount.\n\nFor the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: The units digit 8 appears at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, but 498 is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 in the units place, which is correct. Similarly, in the tens place, we had 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78 for three-digit numbers. So, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 98 8's and 188 4's. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts for 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I said from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's, I had 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. That's correct because in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears at 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 times since 484 is the last one before 488.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for three-digit 4's, plus 19 for two-digit and 1 for one-digit, totaling 188.\n\nFor 8's, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 for three-digit 8's, plus 19 for two-digit and 1 for one-digit, totaling 98.\n\nSo, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the three-digit numbers, especially for the 8's in the tens place. For 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place in 400-488, the 8's are at 408, 418, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **One-digit numbers (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n     - Units place: 9 occurrences (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - Total: 19.\n   - **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n     - Tens place: 40 occurrences (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Units place: 39 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 484).\n     - Total: 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **One-digit numbers (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n     - Units place: 9 occurrences (18, 28, ..., 98).\n     - Total: 19.\n   - **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 39 occurrences (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n     - Units place: 39 occurrences (108, 118, ..., 488).\n     - Total: 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears only once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 pages where 4 is in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place, 4 can appear in 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. Wait, from 10-99, that's 9 decades, so 14,24,...,94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 decades. Each decade has one number ending with 4, so 9 times. But wait, 44 is in the 40-49 range, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, actually, from 10-39, 50-99, the units digit 4 appears once each decade. So, that's 8 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), but wait, 40-49 is a separate case. So, from 10-39, 50-99, that's 8 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 8 occurrences. Wait, but 44 is in 40-49, which we've already counted in the tens place, so maybe it's 9 occurrences? Hmm, no, because 40-49 is a separate case where the tens digit is 4, so the units digits in 40-49 would be 0-9, so 4 appears once in the units place there as well, but that's part of the 40-49 range. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. \n\nFor two-digit numbers, the units digit 4 can appear in 14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94. That's 8 numbers, right? Because from 10-99, excluding 40-49, we have 8 numbers where the units digit is 4. Then, in 40-49, the units digit 4 appears once (page 44). So, total units digit 4's in two-digit numbers would be 8 (from other decades) plus 1 (from 40-49), totaling 9. Wait, but that might be double-counting 44. Hmm, maybe not, because in 40-49, the tens digit is 4, and the units digit is 4 only once. So, maybe the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Wait, but 44 would have both digits as 4, so that's two 4's. So, perhaps I need to count each occurrence separately. So, in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 4's. In the units place, from 10-99, excluding 40-49, we have 8 numbers with 4 in the units place, plus 44, which is in 40-49, so that's 9. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nWait, but let me check that. For two-digit numbers, each position (tens and units) can have a 4. So, in the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. In the units place, 4 can appear in 14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94, which is 8 numbers, plus 44, which is in 40-49, so that's 9 numbers where 4 is in the units place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean that in the units place count, 44 is included, so that's correct. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. So, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds digit being 4, that's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can look at the tens place. \n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, in 200-299: 240-249, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\nIn 300-399: 340-349, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place here. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40. \n\nWait, but let me check 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, 40 total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488. \n\nAgain, considering each hundred:\n\n100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers. \n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294. 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 304,314,...,394. 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: Now, here, the units digit can be 4 from 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we only go up to 484. Let's count: starting from 400, the units digit 4 appears at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, because 484 is the ninth occurrence, right? Wait, 404 is the first, then every 10 pages. So, from 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 = 9 numbers. \n\nSo, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. For 400-488, the units digit 4 appears at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 39 total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers would be hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168. \n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process. \n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens and units places. \n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 pages, so 10 8's in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,58,68,78,88,98. Wait, from 10-99, excluding 80-89, the units digit 8 appears in 18,28,38,58,68,78,98. That's 8 numbers. But wait, 88 is in 80-89, so it's already counted in the tens place. So, the units digit 8 appears 8 times in two-digit numbers outside of 80-89, and once in 88, which is part of 80-89. So, total units digit 8's: 8 + 1 = 9. \n\nWait, but let me think again. For units digit 8 in two-digit numbers, it's 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place. \n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: tens place (10) + units place (9) = 19. \n\nNow, three-digit numbers from 100-488. Let's count 8's in hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 cannot appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place in three-digit numbers. \n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. \n\nWait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). \n\nSo, in 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: how many times does 8 appear in the units place from 100-488. \n\nAgain, per hundred:\n\n100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488. \n\nSo, units digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78. \n\nWait, but let me check: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 78. \n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nSo, total 8's printed: 98. \n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nCounting 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4); in 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more at page 484. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The hundreds go from 0 to 4 (since 488 is less than 500). For each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for hundreds 0-3 (i.e., 0-399), that's 4 hundreds (0,1,2,3), each contributing 10 instances, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, for the hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. However, we only go up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So that's another 10. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so actually, 440-449 is 10 pages, and then from 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from 0-399) + 10 (from 400-449) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again: for the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89. Then, tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds (0-399) give 4*10=40, and then 400-449 gives another 10, so 50. Units place: 48 full tens, each with one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. So, 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten, 8 appears once. So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 consecutive numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For hundreds 0-3 (0-399), each contributes 10 instances, so 4*10=40. Now, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's)= 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens (1-480) each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, page 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 0-399: 4 hundreds, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, 400-449: 10 more, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\nTotal: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens (1-480), each with one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 0-399: 4 hundreds, each with 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, 480-488: 9 pages, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0, since 800+ is beyond 488.\nTotal: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 400-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each group of ten, there's one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Let me check: 484 is in this range, so yes, that's another 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly ten times in each hundred. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. Let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1 to 488, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 401-410 has 401-410, but wait, the tens digit is 0 in 401, 402, etc., and then 1 in 411, etc. Wait, actually, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. Then, 411-420 would have 1 in the tens place, but we're only going up to 488. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 8 in 481-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, each group of ten has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit include an 8? Yes, 488 is in this range, so that's another 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly ten times in each hundred. So, the digit 8 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so that's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we stop at 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but wait: 480 is 480, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, we have 40 from the full hundreds plus 9 from the partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. I had 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, no, wait: I think I made a mistake here. When I was counting the units place for 8's, I considered 488, which is correct, giving 49. Then, in the tens place, I had 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, units (49) + tens (49) = 98. That's correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this because I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, 50, and units place 49, totaling 188. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4, making it 49 in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire set of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, each hundred has one such set. So, from 1-100, there's 40-49, which is one set. Then from 101-200, there's 140-149, another set. Similarly, from 201-300, 240-249, and from 301-400, 340-349. Then from 401-488, there's 440-449. So, that's five sets in total. Each set contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 sets, one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more 8, making it 49 in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire set of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, each hundred has one such set. So from 1-100, 80-89 is one set (10 numbers). Then from 101-200, 180-189, another set. From 201-300, 280-289, another set. From 301-400, 380-389, another set. Then from 401-488, 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so in 401-488, the set would be 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 numbers, right? So, for the tens place, how many full sets of ten are there? Let's see: 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10). Then from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's four full sets contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from the last partial set. So, 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. From 1-100, 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. Then 401-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digits go up to 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which adds one more, so 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That adds up.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), 488 has an 8, so one more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for that partial set. So, four full sets (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488. So, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in 484 = 49\n- **Tens place:** 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.) \u00d7 10 = 50\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 = 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in 488 = 49\n- **Tens place:** 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) \u00d7 10 + 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- **Hundreds place:** 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider the single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, on page 4. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, for the two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. I can break this down by the tens place and the units place. \n\nIn the tens place, the digits go from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 will appear in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. \n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the two-digit numbers (since there are 9 sets of ten: 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, the digit 4 will appear 9 times in the units place. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each ten's group (like 10-19), the units digits cycle from 0-9, so each digit appears once per ten. Since there are 9 tens (10-99), each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. But wait, for 0, it's actually 9 times because the first ten (10-19) includes 10, which is 1 and 0, so 0 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers. So, for the digit 4, in the units place, it's 9 times. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down further. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, we have 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nNow, let's look at the tens place in the three-digit numbers. For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times. \n\nThere are four hundred groups: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens place? Let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears in the numbers 440-449, which is 10 times. So, actually, each hundred group contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, for the three-digit numbers, the tens place contributes 4 (hundred groups) \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Wait, no, that's not right because the 400-488 group only goes up to 488, so the tens digit in that group can only go up to 8, but the digit 4 in the tens place is still present in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, each hundred group contributes 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. \n\nWait, but actually, from 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 times. So, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, the units place in the three-digit numbers. For each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred group, the digit 4 appears in the units place once every 10 numbers. Since there are 10 numbers in each group, the digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred group in the units place. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Each hundred group has 100 numbers, so the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred group, the digit 4 appears in the units place 10 times (once per ten numbers). So, for each hundred group, 10 times. Since there are 4 hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the units place? Let's see: from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in 400-409, units digits 0-9; 410-419, same, and so on up to 480-488. So, how many complete tens are there? From 400-480, that's 81 numbers, which is 8 complete tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once in each of the first 8 tens, so 8 times, and then in 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total in 400-488 for units place: 8 + 1 = 9 times. \n\nWait, that's a bit more detailed. So, for the units place in the 400-488 group, it's 9 times. But for the other hundred groups, each has 10 times. So, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers would be 3 groups \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nWait, let me confirm. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 100 numbers, so units digit 4 appears 10 times in each. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, as we saw, it's 9 times. So, total units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, for the three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (from each hundred group)\n- Units place: 39 times (as calculated above)\n\nWait, but hold on, the hundreds place is only in the 400-488 group, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. \n\nSo, adding them up: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times the digit 4 appears in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188. But let's think: up to page 488, the number of 4's is 188. Hmm, seems possible, but let me check the three-digit count again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (each hundred group contributes 10)\n- Units place: 39 (as calculated)\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach.\n\nSingle-digit: 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nIn the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 9 times (since there are 9 tens groups). So, digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears only in the hundreds place if the page number is 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in the numbers x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit. So, in each hundred group, that's 10 times. \n\nBut wait, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is part of that. So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. But for the other hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers each (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). \n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred group, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred group, it's 10 times. \n\nBut again, for the 400-488 group, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? From 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included. \n\nSo, units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 9 times\n\nTotal units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\nUnits place: 39\nTotal: 78.\n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\nThree-digit: tens 39 + units 39 = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the hundreds place, I had 89 4's, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 pages.\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers, I had 40 4's, which is correct because each hundred group contributes 10, and there are 4 groups.\n\nFor the units place, I had 39 4's, which is correct because 3 groups have 10 each and the last group has 9.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit, plus 1 + 19 = 20, total 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0\nTens place: 39\nUnits place: 39\nTotal: 78\nPlus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but let me think again: is 188 4's and 98 8's correct? Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a book with pages up to 20.\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCount of 4's: pages 4, 14. So, 2 times.\n\nCount of 8's: pages 8, 18. So, 2 times.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, using my method:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: tens place: 1 (40-49, but up to 20, so only 4 in tens place is none because 40-49 is beyond 20. Wait, so in two-digit numbers up to 20, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's in tens place: 0. Units place: 1 (page 14). So, total two-digit 4's: 0 + 1 = 1. Single-digit:1. So total 4's: 2. \n\nSimilarly, 8's: single-digit:1 (page 8). Two-digit: tens place: 0 (since 80-89 is beyond 20). Units place:1 (page 18). So, total 8's:2. Difference:0. Correct.\n\nNow, using my method, for up to page 20:\n\nThree-digit numbers: none, so 0.\n\nSo, seems my method works for this small case.\n\nAnother test: up to page 100.\n\n4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit: tens 10 (40-49), units 9 (pages 4,14,24,...,84,94) but wait, up to 100, so units digit 4 appears 10 times: 4,14,24,...,94. So, 10 times. So, two-digit 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\nThree-digit: 100-100: hundreds place 1, so no 4's. Tens place: 100-100: tens digit 0, so no. Units place: 100: units digit 0, so no. So, three-digit 4's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:1 +20 +0=21.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit: tens 10 (80-89), units 9 (8,18,28,...,98). So, 10 +9=19.\nThree-digit: 100-100: hundreds digit 1, so no 8's. Tens digit: 100-100: tens digit 0, so no. Units digit: 100: units digit 0, so no. So, three-digit 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +0=20.\n\nDifference:21-20=1.\n\nWait, but let's count manually:\n\n4's:4,14,24,34,40-49 (10 numbers), so that's 11 in two-digit, plus single-digit 4: total 12.\n\nWait, no, up to 100, the two-digit numbers are 10-99. So, in two-digit numbers:\n\n4's in tens place:10 (40-49)\n4's in units place:9 (4,14,...,84,94)\nWait, but 4 in units place is from 4,14,...,94, which is 10 numbers (since 4 to 94 is 10 numbers: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So, units place:10.\n\nSo, two-digit 4's:10+10=20.\n\nSingle-digit:1\nThree-digit:0\nTotal:21.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nTwo-digit: tens 10 (80-89), units 9 (8,18,...,98). Wait, 8,18,...,98 is 10 numbers, so units place:10.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's:10+10=20.\n\nSingle-digit:1\nThree-digit:0\nTotal:21.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count. Wait, no, up to 100, page 100 is included. So, in two-digit numbers, 8's in units place:8,18,...,98, which is 10 numbers. So, units place:10. Tens place:80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, two-digit 8's:20.\n\nSingle-digit:1\nThree-digit:0\nTotal 8's:21.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's would be 20, but actually, it's 21. So, 4's:21, 8's:21, difference:0.\n\nWait, but when I thought of up to 20, it worked. So, perhaps my method is correct.\n\nWait, but in the case of up to 100, 4's:21, 8's:21, difference:0.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation for up to 488, I got 188 4's and 98 8's, difference 90.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers for 8's.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, 100-488.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place:0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in:\n\n- 100-199:180-189:10 numbers\n- 200-299:280-289:10 numbers\n- 300-399:380-389:10 numbers\n- 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:\n\nIn each hundred group, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, in 100-199:108,118,...,198:10 numbers\n200-299:208,218,...,298:10 numbers\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10 numbers\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488:9 numbers\n\nSo, total units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers\nTens place:40 (10 per hundred group)\nUnits place:39 (as calculated)\nTotal:89+40+39=168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:168\nTotal 4's:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nIn units place, each digit 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 in 488:48 full groups (480 numbers), with 8 remaining.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears:48 times (each group contributes one 4) plus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 exist? Yes, so that's one more. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for three-digit units place 4's. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up something.\n\nWait, no, this approach is considering all page numbers, not just three-digit. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the units place equally often, except possibly the last digit.\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10): floor(488/10)=48, with a remainder of 8.\n\nSo, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nAdditionally, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9-0 do not.\n\nSo, for digit 4: appears once more in the units place (484).\n\nSo, total units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:48 (from complete decades) +1 (from 488) =49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 units place 4's in three-digit numbers, but this approach is considering all page numbers, including single and two-digit. So, let's see.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I had 1 (single-digit) +19 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) =59 for 4's. But according to this method, units place 4's are 49. There's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconcile.\n\nWait, in the units place, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- In single-digit:4 (1 time)\n- In two-digit:14,24,...,94 (9 times)\n- In three-digit:108,118,...,484 (how many?)\n\nWait, from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 100-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, except the last group.\n\nWait, 100-199:10 times\n200-299:10 times\n300-399:10 times\n400-488: how many times? From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484. That's 9 times (since 404 to 484 is 9 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484).\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers:3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:9 (14,24,...,94)\nThree-digit:39\nTotal units place 4's:1+9+39=49. Which matches the earlier method.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nSingle-digit:8 (1)\nTwo-digit:18,28,...,98 (9)\nThree-digit:108,118,...,488 (from 100-488, units digit 8 appears 10 in each hundred group except the last, which has 9).\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers:\n\n100-199:10 (108,118,...,198)\n200-299:10 (208,...,298)\n300-399:10 (308,...,398)\n400-488:9 (408,...,488)\nTotal:3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle:1\nTwo-digit:9\nThree-digit:39\nTotal units place 8's:1+9+39=49.\n\nSo, units place 4's:49, 8's:49. So, no difference in units place.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each ten's group.\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete hundred groups:4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nIn each hundred group, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for each hundred group, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut for the last hundred group (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:4\u00d710=40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has the digit 8 in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 180-189, etc.), except the last group, which has 480-488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all of 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last group.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:3\u00d710 (from first three groups) +9 (from last group)=39.\n\nSo, tens place 4's:40, 8's:39. Difference:1.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nDigits 1-4 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 4 appears in 400-488:89 times.\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, adding up all digit places:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:40\nHundreds:89\nTotal:49+40+89=178.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, I had 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49+40=89, +89=178. But earlier, when I added single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I had 188. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's see:\n\nWhen considering each digit place separately:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:40\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nBut earlier, when I added single-digit (1), two-digit (19), three-digit (168), total was 188.\n\nWait, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach by not considering that some numbers are being counted multiple times in different digit places.\n\nWait, no, when I counted single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, I was counting the number of times the digit appears in each position, so that should be accurate.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, I'm getting 178, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the digit place approach is correct, and the earlier approach had an error.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIn the single-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4 appears once in units place.\n- 8 appears once in units place.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in tens place (40-49) and 9 times in units place (14,24,...,94).\n- 8 appears 10 times in tens place (80-89) and 9 times in units place (18,28,...,98).\n\nIn three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in hundreds place (400-488:89 numbers, but in hundreds place, it's 1 per number, so 89 times)\n- 4 appears 10 times in tens place per hundred group: 4 groups, so 40 times\n- 4 appears 10 times in units place for each of the first three hundred groups, and 9 times in the last group, total 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Hundreds:89\n- Tens:40\n- Units:39\nTotal:89+40+39=168.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, units place 4's:49, which includes single-digit (1) and two-digit (9) and three-digit (39), totaling 49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 4's:40, which includes two-digit (10) and three-digit (30), but wait, no: in two-digit numbers, tens place 4's are 10 (40-49). In three-digit numbers, tens place 4's are 10 per hundred group \u00d74 groups=40, but wait, no, in three-digit numbers, the tens place 4's are 10 per hundred group, so 4 groups \u00d710=40, but in the last group (400-488), it's only 10 times (440-449). So, total tens place 4's:40.\n\nSo, in the digit place approach:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:40\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:178.\n\nBut in the earlier approach, adding single, two, three-digit:\n\nSingle:1\nTwo-digit:19 (10+9)\nThree-digit:168 (89+40+39)\nTotal:1+19+168=188.\n\nWait, this discrepancy suggests an error in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps in the digit place approach, I'm double-counting or missing something.\n\nWait, no, the digit place approach counts each occurrence of the digit in each position, so units, tens, hundreds separately.\n\nBut in the single, two, three-digit approach, I'm adding the counts from each category, which should also be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the digit place approach.\n\nWait, in the digit place approach, for units place, I have 49 4's. But in the single-digit, two-digit, three-digit approach, units place 4's are 1 (single) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 4's: in single-digit, there are no tens digits, so 0. In two-digit, 10 (40-49). In three-digit, 40 (10 per hundred group \u00d74). So, total tens place 4's:10+40=50. But in the digit place approach, I have 40 for tens place. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, no, in the digit place approach, I considered that in the hundreds group, the tens place 4's are 10 per hundred group, so 4 groups \u00d710=40. But in two-digit numbers, the tens place 4's are another 10. So, total tens place 4's should be 40 (three-digit) +10 (two-digit)=50.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, I only counted 40, which is incorrect. Because the tens place in two-digit numbers also contributes 10.\n\nSo, the digit place approach was missing the two-digit tens place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place in two-digit numbers contributes 10, and in three-digit numbers, 39.\n\nSo, the digit place approach needs to include both two-digit and three-digit tens place counts.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place: two-digit (10) + three-digit"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14), and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here (page 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Each of the 4 sets contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each set of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). There are 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10 = 40. For the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188; total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So that's correct. So, 40 from the first 400 pages and 9 from the last 88, totaling 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's there.\n\nI think that's correct. So, 188 4's minus 98 8's equals 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, totaling 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - 4 sets of 100 (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 440-449, contributing 10.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, totaling 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - 4 sets of 100 (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. I can break this down into the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit can be 4, which would be pages 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The units digit can be 4 in any of the two-digit numbers. So, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, ..., 94. That's 9 times, but wait, starting from 14, which is the first two-digit number with a units digit of 4. So, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But wait, 40 to 49 is already counted in the tens place, so does that affect the units place? No, because in the units place, we're considering all two-digit numbers where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, that's actually 9 times, but 44 has both digits as 4, so that's counted twice, but for the units place, it's just once. So, total units place 4's in two-digit numbers: 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: tens place (10) + units place (9) = 19.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place, I included 44, which is in the tens place as well, but that's okay because each occurrence is counted separately. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but for 4, it's only up to 488, not 499. So, let's see.\n\nFor the hundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 4 in the numbers 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, we're only going up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count each set:\n\n- 140-149: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 240-249: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 340-349: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 440-449: 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit can be 4 in any number from 100 to 488. So, for each hundred, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For 100-199: 104,114,...,194: that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 occurrences. 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 occurrences. Now, 400-488: the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484. How many times? Let's see, starting at 404, each 10 numbers, up to 484. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, because 484 is the last one before 488, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? The first is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total units place 4's: 10 +10 +10 +9 =39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 +40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me double-check. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, and there are four hundreds (1,2,3,4), so 4*10=40. Units place: in each of the first three hundreds, 10 times, and in the last hundred, 9 times, so 3*10 +9=39. So, total 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 1+19=20, 20+168=188? That seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the two-digit numbers, I had 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. Then, three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168. So, 1+19=20, 20+168=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me recount.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, units digit 4:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 200-299: same, 10 times.\n- 300-399: same, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 404,414,...,484. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers with units digit 4? The first is 404, then every 10 numbers. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds, 4*10=40.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8 is the only single-digit page with an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nTens place: the tens digit is 8, which is 80-89. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: the units digit is 8 in numbers like 18,28,...,98. That's 9 numbers (since 18 is the first two-digit number with units digit 8, up to 98). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: the tens digit is 8. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in:\n\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289:10 numbers\n- 380-389:10 numbers\n- 480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: the units digit is 8 in three-digit numbers. Let's break it down:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198: that's 10 numbers\n- 200-299:208,218,...,298:10 numbers\n- 300-399:308,318,...,398:10 numbers\n- 400-488:408,418,...,488. Let's see, starting from 408, each 10 numbers up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:40-49:10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nTotal two-digit 4's:10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place:140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place:104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:80-89:10 numbers.\n\nUnits place:18,28,...,98:9 numbers.\n\nTotal two-digit 8's:10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:108,...,198:10; 208,...,298:10; 308,...,398:10; 408,...,488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I should count the number of times 4 appears in both places. \n\nStarting with the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\nNow, for the units place: In the range 10-99, the 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 10-19, it's 14; in 20-29, it's 24; and so on up to 90-99, which is 94. How many times does this happen? Well, from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten, but wait, actually, from 10 to 99, it's 9 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, it's 9 decades (10-19 is the first decade, 20-29 the second, etc.), but each decade has exactly one number ending with 4. So that's 9 4's. But wait, 40-49 is a separate case where the tens place is 4, so in the units place, we have 44, which is already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, when I count the units place, I should include all numbers where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 occurs once in each decade, so that's 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is a special case where the tens digit is 4, but the units digit can also be 4, so 44 is counted in both. But when I'm counting the units place, I should count all numbers where the units digit is 4, including 44. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times (14,24,...,94). So, that's 9 4's in the units place. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, the digits are in the hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the number of 4's in each place. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4. Let's consider each hundred separately. \n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 4's.\n- For 300-399: 340-349, another 10 4's.\n- For 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. However, since 488 is the last page, we need to check if 440-449 are all within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 4's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, we have 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 4's.\n\nNow, the units place: Again, considering each hundred separately.\n\n- For 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 204,214,...,294. Another 10 4's.\n- For 300-399: 304,314,...,394. Another 10 4's.\n- For 400-488: The units digit is 4 in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, let's count these. Starting from 404, adding 10 each time: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 89, tens:40, units:39. 89+40=129, 129+39=168. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 4's.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's in all page numbers. Let's do the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit numbers: 10-99. Again, counting 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The numbers 80-89 all have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: In the range 10-99, the units digit is 8 once every ten numbers. So, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nWait, but 88 is in both counts, right? When we count the tens place, 88 is included, and when we count the units place, 88 is also included. So, that's correct; each occurrence is counted separately. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nTens place: Let's look for 8's in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers.\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 280-289, another 10 8's.\n- For 300-399: 380-389, another 10 8's.\n- For 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nUnits place: Now, counting 8's in the units digit across all three-digit numbers.\n\n- For 100-199: The units digit is 8 in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 208,218,...,298. Another 10 8's.\n- For 300-399: 308,318,...,398. Another 10 8's.\n- For 400-488: The units digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count these. Starting from 408, adding 10 each time: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is within the range. So, 9 8's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78 8's.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Tens place was 39 and units place was 39, so 39+39=78. Yes.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 8's.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Earlier, for two-digit numbers, I had 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19 8's. For three-digit numbers, tens and units each had 39, so 78. So total 1+19+78=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, single-digit 4's: 1. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit 4's: tens place 40-49 is 10, units place 14,24,...,94 is 9. So 19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit 4's: hundreds place 400-488 is 89. Tens place: 10 in each of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-488 (440-449). So 10*3 +10=40. Units place: 10 in each hundred except the last, which has 9. So 10*3 +9=39. So total 89+40+39=168. Then 1+19+168=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: single-digit 1. Two-digit: tens 80-89 (10), units 18,28,...,98 (9). So 19. Three-digit: hundreds 0. Tens place: 10 in each hundred up to 300-399, and 9 in 400-488. So 10+10+10+9=39. Units place: 10 in each hundred up to 300-399, and 9 in 400-488. So 10+10+10+9=39. So total 39+39=78. Then 1+19+78=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 numbers. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 occurrences. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks of 100 are there? There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40 occurrences. Now, the partial block 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4. \n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, as before, there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8. So, 48 blocks give 48 occurrences, and the partial block (481-488) has 8 in the units place once (488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1 to 488, there are 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial block 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 has an 8 in the tens place, and so do 481-488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place contributes 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. For the tens place in the partial block 401-488, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. To find how many more 4's there are, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's in each place.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 48 full tens (1-480) give 48 4's. Then, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers with 4 in the tens. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but for 4's, it's when the tens digit is 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's: Units place is 49, as calculated. Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens (1-480) contribute 48 4's, and 484 adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 hundreds contribute 40 4's, and 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89 4's.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens contribute 48 8's, and 488 adds 1, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 hundreds contribute 40 8's, and 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider one-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, the two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here, so each of these contributes one 4. Let me count them: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences in the units place. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. \n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only looking for 4's, we need to consider when the hundreds digit is 4. So, the pages from 400 to 488. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: For all pages from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. \n\nLet's break this down by hundreds. \n\n- For pages 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 pages. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149, which is 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences. \n- For pages 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences. \n- For pages 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences. \n- For pages 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 occurrences. \n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488. \n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds: \n\n- For pages 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 sets of 10 pages in 100-199, so 10 occurrences. \n- For pages 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences. \n- For pages 300-399: 10 occurrences. \n- For pages 400-488: Now, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten, but the last set might be incomplete. Let's see: 400-488 is 89 pages. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages, so how many complete cycles are there? 89 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 9. So, there are 8 complete cycles (each contributing one 4) and then 9 more pages (480-488), where the units digit goes from 0-8, so 4 appears once more in 484. \n\nSo, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times. \n\nTherefore, in the units place across all three-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences, so 3 * 10 = 30. Then, 400-488: 9 occurrences. So, total is 30 + 9 = 39. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, in the three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's: one-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 times. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. One-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 168. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. That seems correct. \n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach. \n\nFirst, one-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. \n\nTens place: The numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: The numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, but I'm only counting the units place here, so that's still 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences. \n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488. \n\nBreaking it down by hundreds: \n\n- 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, 180-189 is where 8 is in the tens place, which is 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences. \n- 200-299: Similarly, 280-289, another 10 occurrences. \n- 300-399: 380-389, another 10 occurrences. \n- 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8, so 480-488. The tens digit is 8 here, so 480-488 is 9 pages (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units place from 100-488? \n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds: \n\n- 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 10 sets of 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. \n- 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences. \n- 300-399: 10 occurrences. \n- 400-488: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but the last set might be incomplete. 400-488 is 89 pages. 89 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 9. So, 8 complete cycles (each contributing one 8) and then 9 more pages (480-488), where the units digit goes from 0-8, so 8 appears once more in 488. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so in 400-488, the units digit 8 appears 8 (from 408, 418, ..., 478) plus 1 (488), totaling 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, in the units place across all three-digit numbers, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nTherefore, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times. \n\nNow, summing up all the 8's: one-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 times. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. One-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, plus 78 is 98. That seems correct. \n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just go through my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with the 4's: \n\n- One-digit: 1 (page 4). \n- Two-digit: tens place (40-49:10) + units place (14,24,...,94:9). So, 10+9=19. \n- Three-digit: hundreds place (400-488:89). Tens place: 140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449:10 each, so 40. Units place: 100-199,200-299,300-399: each 10, so 30. 400-488: 480-488 is 9, but wait, in the units place, 400-488: how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, right? So, 30 +9=39. So, units place:39. \n\nSo, three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168. \n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188. \n\nNow, 8's: \n\n- One-digit:1 (page8). \n- Two-digit: tens place (80-89:10) + units place (18,28,...,98:9). So, 10+9=19. \n- Three-digit: hundreds place:0. Tens place:180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 180-189:10, 280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Units place:100-199:10,200-299:10,300-399:10,400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, three-digit 8's:0+39+39=78. \n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit units place for 4's and 8's. Let me verify that again. \n\nFor 4's in units place in three-digit numbers: \n\n- 100-199: 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Wait, earlier I thought it was 10, but then when I broke it down, I considered 400-488 as 9. So, total units place 4's:10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:100-199:108,118,...,198:10. 200-299:10. 300-399:10. 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9, because 488 is included. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nWait, but in the three-digit numbers, for 4's units place, I have 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSimilarly for 8's, same calculation. \n\nSo, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The book has 488 pages. So, when counting up to 488, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 only up to 488, not 500. So, in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 89 pages (400-488). That seems correct. \n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, we have 140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 pages, so 40 total. \n\nIn the units place, 100-199:104,114,...,194:10. 200-299:10. 300-399:10. 400-488:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484:9. So, 39 total. \n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 for three-digit 4's. \n\nFor 8's: \n\nTens place:180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place:108,118,...,198:10. 208,218,...,298:10. 308,...,398:10. 408,418,...,488:9. So, 39 total. \n\nSo, three-digit 8's:39+39=78. \n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the units place in two-digit numbers, I considered 14,24,...,94 as 9 numbers, but actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94). Similarly for 8's. That's correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that in two-digit numbers, for each digit (tens and units), there are 9 possibilities for the tens digit (1-9) and 10 for the units (0-9). So, for each digit place, the count is 9*10=90 numbers. But when looking for a specific digit, like 4 or 8, in a specific place, it's 9 (tens) and 10 (units). Wait, no, for the tens place in two-digit numbers, each digit from 1-9 appears exactly 10 times (e.g., 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times). For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times (since there are 9 decades: 10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). So, for units digit 4 in two-digit numbers, it's 9 times. Similarly for 8. \n\nSo, that part is correct. \n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **One-digit page numbers (1-9):** 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 (10 occurrences).\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 (9 occurrences).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 (89 occurrences).\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (10 each, total 40).\n     - Units place: 104, 114, ..., 194, 204, ..., 294, 304, ..., 394, 404, ..., 484 (10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 for 400-488, total 39).\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **One-digit page numbers (1-9):** 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 (10 occurrences).\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 (9 occurrences).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 8 does not appear (0 occurrences).\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (10 each for first three, 9 for last, total 39).\n     - Units place: 108, 118, ..., 198, 208, ..., 298, 308, ..., 398, 408, 418, ..., 488 (10 each for first three, 9 for last, total 39).\n     - Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each position. \n\nStarting with the tens place: the numbers 40 to 49 all have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nNow, for the ones place: in the two-digit numbers, every ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) will have a 4 in the ones place once. So, from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19 up to 90-99). But wait, 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so in the ones place, each set from 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99 will have a 4 in the ones place. So that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, but when considering the ones place, 40-49 would have 4 in the ones place only once, right? Wait no, in 40-49, the ones digits go from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once in the ones place in each ten's group. So, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's in the ones place is 9, because there are 9 groups of ten (10-19 up to 90-99). Wait, no, actually, 10-99 is 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of ten. So, in each group, the ones digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit, including 4, appears once per group. So, 9 groups \u00d7 1 occurrence = 9 occurrences. But wait, in the tens place, we already counted 10 occurrences from 40-49. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. \n\nWait, but wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. Then, in the ones place, from 10-99, every ten has a 4 in the ones place once, so that's 9 times (since 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, 9. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nWait, but 10-99 is 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, yes, 9 occurrences in the ones place. So, 19 in total for two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down by hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. \n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Here, the hundreds digit is 1, so 4's in the hundreds place are 0. \n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so 4's in hundreds place are 0. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so 4's in hundreds place are 0. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let's count the 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. \n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, so in each set of ten (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the tens place. There are 10 sets of ten in 100-199, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Again, 10 sets of ten, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Same logic, 10 occurrences. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, which is 9 sets of ten. In each set, 4 appears once in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, that's 9 sets of ten. So, in each set, 4 appears once in the tens place, so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39. \n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds=1, 100-199: tens digits 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 in tens place: 10 times. Similarly for hundreds=2 and 3. For hundreds=4, tens digits go up to 8, so 9 times, each with 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, but when counting the tens digit, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8, but the tens digit is 8, so 4 in the tens place would be when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. \n\nIn the hundreds=4 group (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. For each tens digit, the ones digit cycles 0-9, except for the last group, which is 480-488, where the ones digit goes up to 8. \n\nSo, for tens digit 0: 400-409: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nSimilarly, tens digit 1: 410-419: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nTens digit 2: 420-429: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nTens digit 3: 430-439: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nTens digit 4: 440-449: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nTens digit 5: 450-459: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nTens digit 6: 460-469: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nTens digit 7: 470-479: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place once. \n\nTens digit 8: 480-488: 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so 4 in the tens place would be when the tens digit is 4, which is already counted in tens digit 4 (440-449). So, in the hundreds=4 group, the tens digit runs from 0 to 8, and in each of these, 4 appears once in the tens place except when the tens digit is 8, but 4 in the tens place is only when the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, I'm mixing up. \n\nWait, no, the tens digit is 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, regardless of the hundreds digit, for each hundreds group, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 per hundreds group, except when the hundreds group ends before the tens digit cycles fully. \n\nWait, but in the hundreds=4 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the tens digits are 0-8. So, in this case, the tens digit 4 occurs once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. So, for hundreds=4, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, in the hundreds=4 group, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, the total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers would be: \n\n- Hundreds=1: 10 (tens digit 4 occurs 10 times)\n- Hundreds=2: 10\n- Hundreds=3: 10\n- Hundreds=4: 10\nTotal: 10+10+10+10 = 40. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39, but now I'm getting 40. Hmm, where did I go wrong? \n\nWait, no, because in the hundreds=4 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences. So, for each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so 4 hundreds groups \u00d7 10 = 40. So, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving on to the ones place for three-digit numbers. \n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), in each set of ten numbers, the ones digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once in the ones place per set of ten. \n\nLet's calculate for each hundreds group: \n\n- Hundreds=1 (100-199): There are 10 sets of ten (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199). Each set has one 4 in the ones place, so 10 occurrences. \n\n- Hundreds=2 (200-299): Similarly, 10 sets, 10 occurrences. \n\n- Hundreds=3 (300-399): 10 sets, 10 occurrences. \n\n- Hundreds=4 (400-488): Now, here, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group, but since the last tens group is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, does that affect the count? \n\nWait, in the ones place, for each tens group, the ones digit cycles 0-9, so even if the last group is 480-488, the ones digit still goes up to 8. So, in the tens group 480-488, the ones digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once in the ones place (484). So, for each tens group, whether it's complete or not, the ones digit 4 appears once if the tens group is within the range. \n\nBut wait, in the hundreds=4 group, how many tens groups are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens groups. Each tens group has one occurrence of 4 in the ones place, except perhaps the last one. Wait, no, in each tens group, the ones digits go from 0 to 9, except the last group, which is 480-488, so ones digits go up to 8. So, in 480-488, the ones digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484). \n\nSo, for hundreds=4, the number of 4's in the ones place is 9 (from tens groups 400-409 up to 470-479) plus 1 from 480-488, totaling 9 + 1 = 10? Wait, no, because the tens groups are 400-409 (tens=0), 410-419 (tens=1), ..., 480-488 (tens=8). So, that's 9 tens groups, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, except the last one, which only goes up to 8, but 484 is within 480-488, so that's one occurrence. So, total 9 + 1 = 10 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 480-488 is the 9th tens group, so each of the 9 tens groups contributes one 4 in the ones place, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is the 9th group, and in that group, 484 is present, so that's one occurrence. So, total 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but in the hundreds=4 group, how many tens groups are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 groups. Each group has one 4 in the ones place, so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, for hundreds=4, the ones place 4's are 9. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundreds group has 10 occurrences, but that's not correct because the last group is incomplete. So, let me recalculate: \n\n- Hundreds=1: 10 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the ones place: 10\n- Hundreds=2: 10\n- Hundreds=3: 10\n- Hundreds=4: 9 (since the last tens group is incomplete, but still has one 4 in the ones place at 484)\nSo, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 per hundreds group, but that's not correct because the last group is incomplete. So, hundreds=4 contributes 9, while the others contribute 10 each. So, total 39.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds=4 group, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 tens groups. Each tens group has one 4 in the ones place, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in the ones place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 39. I need to clarify this.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the total number of three-digit page numbers and then determine how many 4's are in the ones place.\n\nTotal three-digit pages: 488 - 99 = 389 pages (from 100 to 488). \n\nIn the ones place, each digit from 0-9 appears approximately the same number of times. So, 389 pages, the ones digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 389 / 10 = 38 full cycles, with 9 remaining pages. \n\nIn each full cycle, 4 appears once in the ones place. So, 38 \u00d7 1 = 38. Then, in the remaining 9 pages, which are 480-488, the ones digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total ones place 4's: 38 + 1 = 39.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 39 occurrences in the ones place for three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (10 per hundreds group \u00d7 4)\n- Ones place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99):\n\nIn the tens place: numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the ones place: in each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), 8 appears once in the ones place. There are 9 such sets (since 80-89 is already counted in the tens place), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit can be 0-9, so 8 appears once per hundreds group in the tens place. \n\n- Hundreds=1: 100-199: 10 occurrences (80-89 in each hundred? Wait, no, in the tens place, for hundreds=1, the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n- Similarly, hundreds=2: 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds=3: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds=4: 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nOnes place: For each hundreds group, in each set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the ones place. \n\n- Hundreds=1: 100-199: 10 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the ones place: 10\n- Hundreds=2: 200-299: 10\n- Hundreds=3: 300-399: 10\n- Hundreds=4: 400-488: How many sets of ten? From 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. \n\nIn hundreds=4, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens groups. Each tens group contributes one 8 in the ones place, except the last group (480-488), which only goes up to 8. \n\nSo, in each of the 9 tens groups, the ones digit 8 appears once, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but in the last group, 480-488, the ones digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the ones place. So, in each tens group, 8 appears once in the ones place, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds=4, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 tens groups. In each group, the ones digit 8 appears once, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Ones place: 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Ones place: 39\nTotal: 168\n\nBut earlier, I thought the hundreds place was 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nThen, two-digit numbers: 19\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTotal 4's: 168 + 19 +1 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Ones place: 39\nTotal:78\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTotal 8's:78 +19 +1=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99) has one 4 in the units place \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred's group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 occurrences in the tens place for each hundred except the last, which has 9 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units place:** Each hundred's group has 10 occurrences except the last, which has 9 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 39 + 39 = 167.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 167 (three-digit) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Each ten's group has one 8 in the units place \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred's group has 10 occurrences in the tens place \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units place:** Each hundred's group has 10 occurrences except the last, which has 9 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: these range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 fours. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, the last one is 94. So, that's 9 numbers. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I'm not double-counting. No, actually, when I'm counting the number of times 4 appears, each occurrence is counted separately. So, in the units place, from 10 to 99, how many 4's are there? It's every 10 numbers, so 10 times, but starting from 14, 24, etc., up to 94. That's 9 times, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so actually, the total number of 4's in the units place is 9. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit is 4 once. So, there are 9 such groups (10-19 to 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 fours. Plus, the 44 has an additional 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted in the tens place count. Wait, no, the 44's tens place was counted in the tens place count (40-49), so the units place is separate. So, in the units place, 14,24,...,94: that's 9 fours. So, total in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 fours. \n\nWait, but 44 is included in both counts, but each digit is counted separately. So, 44 contributes two 4's, one in the tens and one in the units. So, the total is correct: 10 + 9 = 19 fours in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to count the number of 4's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's here.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Again, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit from 100 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range x40-x49, where x is the hundreds digit. \n\nSo, for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 fours.\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 fours.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but we only go up to 488, so 440-449 is within range. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place across all hundreds are 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 fours.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so when considering the tens digit, is 440-449 entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 10 fours there.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488.\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. For each hundred, in each ten's group, the units digit is 4 once. So, for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: In each ten's group (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit is 4 once per ten's group. There are 10 ten's groups, so 10 fours.\n- Similarly for 200-299: 10 fours.\n- 300-399: 10 fours.\n- 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because it's not a full hundred. Let's see, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear?\n\nEach ten's group in 400-488 is 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, let's count how many complete ten's groups there are and how many incomplete.\n\nFrom 400-488, the ten's groups are:\n\n- 400-409: complete, 10 numbers\n- 410-419: complete\n- 420-429: complete\n- 430-439: complete\n- 440-449: complete\n- 450-459: complete\n- 460-469: complete\n- 470-479: complete\n- 480-488: incomplete, 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 8 complete ten's groups and one incomplete. In each complete ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once (e.g., 404, 414, etc.). So, 8 times. In the incomplete group, 480-488, the units digit 4 would be at 484. So, that's one more. So, total in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 fours.\n\nSo, total units digit fours in three-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So, yes, 39 in total.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all fours in single, two, and three-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Yes.\n\nNow, moving on to count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The single-digit 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. Again, count the 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: Numbers where the units digit is 8: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, we have 9 eights, but 88 is included in both tens and units counts. However, when counting occurrences, each digit is counted separately, so 88 contributes two 8's. So, in the units place, from 10-99, how many times does 8 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 9 times (18,28,...,98). So, 9 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but 88 is in the 80-89 range, so the units place count is 9, including 88's units digit. So, total in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, so in the tens place, 80-89: 10 eights, and in the units place, 18,28,...,98: 9 eights, including 88's units digit. So, total is 10 + 9 = 19 eights. But 88 is counted twice, but each occurrence is counted separately, so that's correct.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place here, since 8 is a single digit and the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, in the tens digit, 8 can appear in each hundred's group. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n\nSo, for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place across all hundreds:\n\n10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 eights.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: Count how many times 8 appears in the units digit from 100-488.\n\nFor each hundred, in each ten's group, the units digit is 8 once per ten's group. So:\n\n- 100-199: 109,118,128,...,198: 10 eights.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 10 eights.\n- 300-399: 10 eights.\n- 400-488: Now, let's see, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 9 eights.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 occur? Let's list them:\n\n408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total units digit eights in three-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 eights.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I'm counting units digits, each hundred has 10 eights, except the last one which has 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal eights in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78 eights.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the tens place in three-digit numbers had 39 eights, and the units place also had 39 eights. So, total eights in three-digit numbers would be 39 + 39 = 78 eights.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the counts.\n\nTens place: 10 (100s) +10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s) = 39 eights.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100s)+10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s) = 39 eights.\n\nSo, yes, 39 +39=78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all eights in single, two, and three-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 +19=20, 20+78=98. Yes.\n\nSo, total fours: 188\n\nTotal eights: 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nCounting fours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds: 400-488: 89 fours\n\nTens: 10 (100s)+10 (200s)+10 (300s)+10 (400s)=40\n\nUnits: 10 (100s)+10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s)=39\n\nTotal three-digit fours: 89+40+39=168\n\nTotal fours:1+19+168=188\n\nCounting eights:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens)+9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens:10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal three-digit eights:39+39=78\n\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I count each occurrence. Let me list them out: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but each contributes one 4 in the units place, except 44, which has an extra 4 in the tens place. But since I'm only counting the units place here, it's still 9 occurrences. Wait, no, 44 has two 4's, so when I count the units place, it's still just one 4 in the units place for 44, right? So, 9 occurrences in the units place. So, for two-digit numbers, 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. \n\nFor each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149 in 100-199). \n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 block, the tens digit can go up to 8, so the 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, the 400-488 block only goes up to 488, so the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences. Since there are 4 hundred blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit still cycles 0-8, so 440-449 is still 10 numbers, so yes, 10 occurrences. So, 40 in total.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred block, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place, so 10 occurrences per hundred block.\n\nBut wait, let me think. For example, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the units digit can go up to 8 in 488, but 488 is included, so 484 would be included as well. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 484 is 484, so from 404 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = 9 numbers. Wait, but 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484: that's 9 numbers. But wait, 400-488 includes 488, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so yes, only 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 block, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, not 10. So, I need to adjust that.\n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 194)\n- 200-299: 10 occurrences\n- 300-399: 10 occurrences\n- 400-488: 9 occurrences (404, 414, ..., 484)\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred block had 10, but 400-488 only has 9. So, total units place 4's: 39.\n\nWait, but let me recount. From 100-199: 104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488, starting at 404, each 10 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, units place: 39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total 4's are:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for two-digit numbers, I had 10 in the tens place (40-49) and 9 in the units place (14,24,...,94), but 44 is included in both, so does that mean I double-counted the 4 in 44? Wait, no, because in the tens place, it's the first digit, and in the units place, it's the second digit. So, 44 has two 4's, so in the tens place count, I counted one 4, and in the units place count, I counted another 4. So, that's correct; 44 contributes two 4's, so the total is indeed 10 + 9 = 19 for two-digit numbers. So, 19 is correct.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488), tens place: 40 (10 per hundred block), units place: 39 (as above). So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 8 is present once, at page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 8 can appear in the tens or units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: The numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's. So, in the units place, each of these contributes one 8, so 9 occurrences. So, total two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: In each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit 8 in the tens place occurs for 10 numbers: e.g., 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, etc.\n\nBut wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-489 would be the range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 400-488 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 (180-189)\n- 200-299: 10 (280-289)\n- 300-399: 10 (380-389)\n- 400-488: 9 (480-488)\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, in each hundred block, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred block, 10 occurrences.\n\nBut in the 400-488 block, the units digit 8 can appear in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so 408,418,...,488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 (108,118,...,198)\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, total 8's:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For three-digit numbers, the tens place 8's: 10 per hundred block except the last one, which has 9. So, 3 * 10 + 9 = 39. Similarly, units place: 3 * 10 + 9 = 39. So, total 78. Then, adding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in three-digit numbers. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Tens place: 10 per hundred block, 4 blocks, so 40. Units place: 10 in each of the first three blocks, and 9 in the last, so 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 4's: 168 + 20 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds place: 0. Tens place: 10 in each of the first three blocks, and 9 in the last, so 39. Units place: same, 39. So, 78. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. Total 8's: 78 + 20 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the units place for three-digit numbers, I might have missed something. Let me check the units place again.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, units place 4's:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10\n- 300-399: 304,...,394: 10\n- 400-488: 404,414,...,484: 9 numbers (since 484 is the last one before 488)\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10\n- 200-299: 208,...,298:10\n- 300-399: 308,...,398:10\n- 400-488: 408,418,...,488:9\n\nSo, 10 +10 +10 +9=39.\n\nSo, yes, 39 each.\n\nThus, the total 4's: 188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 4's in three-digit numbers, I considered each hundred block contributing 10, including 400-488. But in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 10 per hundred block, including the last one.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place in 400-488, it's 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 units place 4's in the last block.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears only once here, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Let me count these. From 10 to 99, every ten numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, 44 is already counted in the tens place, so does that affect the count here? No, because when I'm counting the units place, I'm considering all occurrences, regardless of the tens digit. So, 44 has a 4 in both places, but I'm counting each occurrence separately. So, 9 times in the units place. \n\nWait, but from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. So, the units place gives me 9 fours. So, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nAdding that to the single-digit count, the total number of 4's so far is 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more involved because each number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to count the number of 4's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each will have 100 numbers (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). For each of these, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4 doesn't appear here. The only hundreds digit where 4 appears is 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds:\n\n1. Numbers 100-399: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Since there are three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\n2. Numbers 400-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4. The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 times.\n\nAdding these together, the tens place contributes 30 + 10 = 40 times where 4 appears.\n\nNow, the units place. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 exactly 10 times. Let's again break this down:\n\n1. Numbers 100-399: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times.\n\n2. Numbers 400-488: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. Since the last page is 488, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last group. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, but the units digit can still go up to 9 in the tens group before 488. Wait, no, let me think again. From 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-9 for each tens group, except the last one. Wait, no, 488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the units digits go from 0-8 in the 480-488 range. So, for the units digit in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each hundred. From 400-488, the units digit is 4 in the numbers 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Let me count these. From 400-488, every ten numbers, the units digit is 4 once. So, how many such tens groups are there?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit (0-8), there's one number ending with 4. So, that's 9 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 30 from 100-399, the units place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 times where 4 appears.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it would be 30 (from 100-399) plus 9 (from 400-488), which is 39. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 404, 414, ..., up to 484. Since 488 is the last page, 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond. So, from 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 times. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) is 168. But wait, earlier, in two-digit numbers, I had 19 fours, and single-digit had 1, so total fours would be 1 + 19 + 168 = 188? That seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nTens place: In 100-399, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 30 + 10 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: In 100-399, each hundred has 10 fours in the units place, so 3 * 10 = 30. In 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times, as we saw. So, 30 + 9 = 39. So, 39 fours in the units place.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers. Adding the two-digit and single-digit, 1 + 19 = 20, so total fours are 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let's go with that for now. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit numbers: 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Let's count the number of 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: The numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, but wait, from 10-99, each ten has one number ending with 8, except that 88 is in the 80-89 range, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, in the units place, it's 9 times.\n\nWait, but from 10-99, the units digit 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has both digits as 8, so when counting units place, we include it. So, units place contributes 9 eights.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nAdding the single-digit count, total eights so far are 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100-488. Again, we'll count the number of 8's in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in any three-digit page number here, since the highest is 488, which has 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nTens place: Let's break this down by hundreds.\n\n1. Numbers 100-399: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times.\n\n2. Numbers 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8, since 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nAdding these together, the tens place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 8 exactly 10 times. Let's break this down:\n\n1. Numbers 100-399: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 8 (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times.\n\n2. Numbers 400-488: The units digit is 8 in numbers like 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count these. From 400-488, every ten numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, how many such tens groups are there?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit (0-8), there's one number ending with 8. So, that's 9 numbers: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, 400-488 contributes 9 eights.\n\nAdding that to the previous 30 from 100-399, the units place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding the two-digit and single-digit counts, total eights are 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, so total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my counting because 188 fours seems high.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I had 89 fours in the hundreds place, 40 in the tens, and 39 in the units, totaling 168. Then, adding the two-digit and single-digit, 1 + 19 = 20, so 168 + 20 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, in three-digit numbers, tens place was 39 and units place 39, totaling 78. Adding single-digit and two-digit, 1 + 19 = 20, so 78 + 20 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers, especially the units place for 4's. From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 9 units place 4's in 400-488, plus 30 from 100-399, total 39. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in 400-488, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTens place for fours: In 100-399, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30. In 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 30 + 10 = 40. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 30 from 100-399, and 9 from 400-488, total 39. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit, plus 19 in two-digit, plus 1 in single-digit: 168 + 19 = 187, plus 1 is 188. Correct.\n\nFor eights, hundreds place: 0. Tens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Units place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78 in three-digit. Plus 19 in two-digit, plus 1 in single-digit: 78 + 19 = 97, plus 1 is 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 100-399 \u2192 3 sets of 10, totaling 30; 400-488 \u2192 10 (440-449).

    "text": " I'll consider each position in the page number separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, the 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets of 10 are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full sets, and then in the partial set, we have 484, which is another 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens position for a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's 5 blocks. However, the last block (401-488) isn't a full hundred, but the tens digit 4 appears in 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, each of the 5 blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me do the math: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, I'll do the same process for the digit 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, up to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488) which includes 488. So, the units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens position for a block of 10 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Again, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 401-488, which includes 480-488. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, but actually, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, but wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, does that mean in the last block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times instead of 10? Hmm, I think so. So, for the tens place, each full hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 8's, but the last block (401-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 4 full blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, but actually, the last block is only up to 488, so maybe I should adjust that. Let me clarify:\n\n- 1-100: tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n- 101-200: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n- 201-300: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- 301-400: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks with 10 8's each and 1 block with 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484, which is the 49th. So, 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred block has 10 4's in the tens place. There are 5 hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). However, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred block except the last contributes 10 8's. The last block contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets of 10 and a partial set (481-488) with 484. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49. Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89. Each full hundred block contributes 10, but the last block (401-488) contributes 9. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears exactly once here, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For the units place, 4 can appear in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, let me count that. From 10 to 99, how many numbers end with 4? Well, starting from 14, each decade (10s, 20s, etc.) has one number ending with 4. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 decades, so 9 times. But wait, 44 is included in both the tens and units place. So, I should count it once in the tens and once in the units, so 10 + 9 = 19? Wait, no, because from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's place, there's one 4 in the units place. So, for 10-19, it's 14; 20-29, 24; up to 90-99, 94. That's 9 times in the units place. Plus, 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, total for two-digit numbers, 10 + 9 = 19. So, single-digit plus two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. But wait, that can't be right because when I get to three-digit numbers, I might have more. Wait, let me check again. Wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. Then, in the units place, from 10 to 99, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 is already counted in the tens place. So, does that mean I should count 9 in the units place? So, 10 + 9 = 19. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 19. Then, single-digit is 1, so 1 + 19 = 20. Now, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down further. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's consider each case.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place here? It doesn't, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, 0 times.\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so 4 doesn't appear here. 0 times.\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so 0 times.\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers: 89.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (units 0-9). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Once every 100 numbers, so in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, the tens digit is 4 for 240-249, another 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Tens digit 4 is 340-349, another 10. So, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449. How many numbers is that? From 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. For each hundreds digit, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once. So, 10 times (104,114,...,194).\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 10 times (204,214,...,294).\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 10 times (304,314,...,394).\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the units digit 4 appears in numbers 404,414,...,484. How many are there? Let's see, from 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? Starting at 404, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, that's 9 numbers, because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's see: 404 is the first, then every 10 pages. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had single-digit and two-digit numbers contributing 20 4's. So, total 4's in the entire book would be 20 (from 1-99) + 168 (from 100-488) = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, so 20. Three-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168. So, 20+168=188. So, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit numbers: 1-9. Only page 8 has an 8, so that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:10-99. Let's break it down into tens and units places.\n\nTens place: numbers where the tens digit is 8. That's 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: numbers where the units digit is 8, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10-99, how many numbers end with 8? They are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 88 is included here, which also has an 8 in the tens place. But when counting units place, we're only considering the units digit, so 88 would count once for units place. So, total units place 8's:9.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nAdding single-digit:1, so total 8's from 1-99:1+19=20.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers:100-488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: 8 can appear only if the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here. So, 0 times.\n\nTens place: Now, for each hundreds digit, we'll check how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Tens digit 8 is 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Tens digit 8 is 280-289, another 10. So, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Tens digit 8 is 380-389, another 10. So, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Tens digit 8 is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: for each hundreds digit, count how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 8: from 400-488, how many numbers end with 8? Starting at 408, then 418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, as 488 is included. So, 9.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78. Plus hundreds place 0, so total 78.\n\nAdding the 8's from 1-99:20, so total 8's in the entire book:20 +78=98.\n\nWait, let me confirm that again. From 1-99:20 8's. From 100-488:78 8's. So, total 8's:20+78=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had 8's in three-digit numbers as 39 (tens) +39 (units) =78. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page4).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10 numbers, so 10 4's. Units place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9 numbers. So, 10+9=19. Plus single-digit 1: total 20.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place:100-199:140-149:10; 200-299:240-249:10; 300-399:340-349:10; 400-488:440-449:10. So, 10*4=40.\n\nUnits place:100-199:104,114,...,194:10; 200-299:204,...,294:10; 300-399:304,...,394:10; 400-488:404,...,484:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Plus 20:188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page8).\n\nTwo-digit:80-89:10; units place 18,28,...,98:9. So, 10+9=19. Plus single-digit 1:20.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:180-189:10; 280-289:10; 380-389:10; 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:108,...,198:10; 208,...,298:10; 308,...,398:10; 408,...,488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. Plus 20:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers when counting 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFor 4's in units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds=1:104,114,...,194:10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds=2:204,...,294:10.\n\n- Hundreds=3:304,...,394:10.\n\n- Hundreds=4:404,414,...,484. Wait, how many? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10. Let's list them:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, as 484 is the last before 488. So, 9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds=1:108,...,198:10.\n\n- Hundreds=2:208,...,298:10.\n\n- Hundreds=3:308,...,398:10.\n\n- Hundreds=4:408,...,488:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 for 8's in three-digit numbers, plus 20 from 1-99:98.\n\nSimilarly, 4's:20 from 1-99, plus 168 from 100-488:188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted in the three-digit numbers. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit for each position.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total groups of 10:488/10=48 full groups, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So, 48 times, plus if the remaining numbers include a 4 in the units place. From 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 in three-digit numbers and 9 in two-digit and single-digit, totaling 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is better. Let me try it again.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, it appears once. So, total number of 10s in 488 is 48 full decades (1-10,11-20,...,481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last decade is 481-490, but we stop at 488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 (from each decade) plus 1 if the last partial decade includes a 4. Since 481-488 includes 484, which is a units digit 4, so total 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400,401-500). Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so up to 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, in the last hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 in the tens place for three-digit numbers, which seems consistent.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. Wait, but that adds up to 49+40+89=178. But earlier, I had 188. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, in the first approach, I counted single-digit and two-digit numbers separately, getting 20, and three-digit numbers as 168, totaling 188. Now, using this digit-by-digit approach, I'm getting 178. There must be a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit approach, for units place, I counted 49 times 4 appears in the units place from 1-488. Similarly, tens place:40, hundreds place:89. So, 49+40+89=178.\n\nBut in the earlier method, I had 20 (from 1-99) +168 (from 100-488)=188. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the digit-by-digit approach is overcounting. Because when I count units place 49, that includes all 4's in the units place across all numbers, including single-digit and two-digit. Similarly, tens place 40 includes all 4's in the tens place across all numbers. So, perhaps the correct total is 178, not 188.\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller example to see which method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a book with pages 1-20. Let's count the number of 4's.\n\nUsing the first method:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page4).\n\nTwo-digit:40-49, but wait, 20 is the limit, so two-digit numbers are 10-20.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, 4 appears in the tens place only in 40-49, but since we're only up to 20, there are no two-digit numbers with 4 in the tens place. In the units place, 14 is the only one. So, two-digit:1.\n\nTotal 4's:1+1=2.\n\nNow, using the digit-by-digit approach:\n\nUnits place: from 1-20, 4 appears in 4 and 14, so 2 times.\n\nTens place: from 1-20, 4 appears in 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: none, since we're only up to 20.\n\nSo, total 4's:2+0+0=2. Correct.\n\nNow, using the digit-by-digit approach for units, tens, hundreds, I get the correct count.\n\nBut in the earlier method, when I separated single-digit and two-digit, I got 2, which matches. So, perhaps both methods are correct, but in the initial problem, the digit-by-digit approach is giving me 178, while the other method gave me 188.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me recount.\n\nUnits place 4's: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, once. So, 488 /10=48 full decades, each contributing one 4. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, which is one more. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nTens place 4's: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred. In each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4*10=40. In the fifth hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Wait, no, because in the fifth hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, when I broke down three-digit numbers, I had 40 in the tens place. Now, using this approach, I have 50. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. For tens place 4's:\n\n- 1-100:40-49:10.\n\n- 101-200:140-149:10.\n\n- 201-300:240-249:10.\n\n- 301-400:340-349:10.\n\n- 401-488:440-449:10.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n\nSo, tens place 4's:50.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place 4's: from 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nUnits place 4's:49.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nAh, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the tens place was 40. It's actually 50, because in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so adding 10 to the previous 40, making it 50.\n\nSo, that aligns with the initial method where I had 168 4's in three-digit numbers, which included 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168. Then, adding the 20 from 1-99, we get 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, using the digit-by-digit approach:\n\nUnits place 8's: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit?\n\nSame as 4's: every 10 numbers, once. So, 488/10=48 full decades, each contributing one 8. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is one more. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place 8's: in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40. In the fifth hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place 8's: from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, now, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I used the digit-by-digit approach, I thought I had a discrepancy, but now it's clear. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut let me just confirm with the initial method.\n\nIn the initial method, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1.\n\n- Two-digit:19.\n\n- Three-digit:168.\n\nTotal:1+19+168=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1.\n\n- Two-digit:19.\n\n- Three-digit:78.\n\nTotal:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit '4' appears 10 times in the tens place, totaling 40.\n     - Units place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit '4' appears 10 times, and in 400-488, it appears 9 times \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit pages: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = **188**.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit '8' appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n     - Tens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit '8' appears 10 times, and in 400-488, it appears 9 times \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Units place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit '8' appears 10 times, and in 400-488, it appears 9 times \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit pages: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = **78**.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = **98**.\n\n3. **"

    "text": " I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each group, the units digit is 4 once. So, 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in each of these hundreds blocks. Let me count them:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers (since 449 is within 488)\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, for every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such groups? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups and an extra 8 pages. Each group contributes one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9.\n\nWait, let's count them:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers\n\nSo, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as I thought. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems right.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the numbers 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the ones place in two-digit numbers, the numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to be careful not to double count. However, when counting the number of times 4 appears, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's. So, how many numbers end with 4 in the two-digit range? From 10 to 99, every ten has a number ending with 4. That's 9 occurrences (14,24,...,94). But wait, 44 is included in both the tens place and the ones place. But when I count the tens place, I already counted the 4 in 44, and now when I count the ones place, I count the other 4. So, total for the ones place in two-digit numbers is 9 times, but actually, from 10 to 99, the numbers ending with 4 are 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, except 44 which contributes two. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Each of these numbers has exactly one 4 in the ones place, except 44, which has two 4's, but when we count the ones place, each number contributes only one digit in that place. So, 14 has a 4 in the ones place, 24 has a 4 in the ones place, etc., up to 94. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 is included here, but in the tens place, we've already counted the 4 in the tens place. So, the total number of 4's in the ones place for two-digit numbers is 9, and in the tens place, it's 10 (from 40-49). So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. \n\nWait, but 44 is counted twice here: once in the tens place and once in the ones place, which is correct because it has two 4's. So, that's okay.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but not beyond. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The hundreds place is 1, so no 4's there. So, no contribution to the count of 4's from the hundreds place in this range.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Hundreds digit is 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, let's move to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break this down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, the tens digit is 4 for 240-249, another 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 4 for 340-349, 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the tens digit can go up to 8, since 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences. However, we also need to consider if there's a 4 in the tens place beyond 449, but since 488 is the limit, the next would be 450-459, etc., but 450-459 don't have a 4 in the tens place. So, only 440-449 contribute 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, let's check the ones place in three-digit numbers. The ones digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each hundred, the ones digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the ones digit is 4 once per ten numbers. So, in 100-199, the numbers ending with 4 are 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, numbers ending with 4 are 204,214,...,294, which is 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Numbers ending with 4 are 304,314,...,394, another 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, we need to be careful here. The ones digit is 4 in numbers like 404,414,424,...,484. But since the book ends at 488, the last such number is 484. So, how many numbers is that? Starting from 404, each ten has one number ending with 4. So, from 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 = 9 numbers. Wait, let me check: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for the ones place in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. Three-digit: hundreds:89, tens:40, ones:39. So, 89+40=129, 129+39=168. Then 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit numbers (1-9): The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nOnes place: Numbers ending with 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the ones place, so 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 has two 8's, but when counting the ones place, we're only counting the ones digit, so each number contributes one 8 in the ones place, regardless of other digits. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. Only when the hundreds digit is 8 would there be 8's in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Tens digit is 8 for 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Tens digit 8 for 280-289, another 10.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 8 for 380-389, another 10.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Tens digit 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 in all of these. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing a 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39.\n\nOnes place: Let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Ones digit is 8 for 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Ones digit 8 for 208,218,...,298, another 10.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Ones digit 8 for 308,318,...,398, another 10.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Ones digit 8 for 408,418,...,488. Let's see, from 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place.\n\nSo, total for ones place in three-digit numbers: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit: tens=39, ones=39. So, 39+39=78\nTotal 8's =1 +19 +78=98\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (ones)=19\n\nThree-digit: tens=39, ones=39. So, 39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:40-49:10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- Ones place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, so 9.\n\nTotal two-digit:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\n- Tens place: in each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each except the last hundred where it's 10 numbers (440-449). So, 10+10+10+10=40.\n\n- Ones place: in each hundred, numbers ending with 4:10 each except the last hundred where it's 9 (404,414,...,484). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n- Ones place:18,28,...,98:9 numbers, so 9.\n\nTotal two-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: in hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers (180-189, etc.), and in hundreds 4:480-488:9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\n- Ones place: in hundreds 1,2,3:10 each, and in hundreds 4:9 (408,...,488). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit numbers, especially in the ones place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the ones place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds 1:104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds 2:204,214,...,294:10\n\n- Hundreds 3:304,314,...,394:10\n\n- Hundreds 4:404,414,...,484: from 404 to 484, stepping by 10. 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, as 484 is the last one before 488.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the ones place:\n\n- Hundreds 1:108,118,...,198:10\n\n- Hundreds 2:208,218,...,298:10\n\n- Hundreds 3:308,318,...,398:10\n\n- Hundreds 4:408,418,...,488: from 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, for each hundred except the last, we have 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and in the last hundred, also 10 numbers (440-449). So, 40 in total.\n\nAnd in the ones place, 39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168.\n\nAdding the two-digit and single-digit, 1+19=20, so total 188.\n\nFor 8's, in the three-digit numbers, the tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOnes place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 78.\n\nPlus single and two-digit:1+19=20, total 98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only occurrence of 4 is on page 4. So that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. So, I'll need to consider both positions.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: The numbers where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the ones place in two-digit numbers: The numbers where the ones digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, that's 9 numbers, right? Because from 10 to 99, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the ones place. So that's 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I counted it twice? Hmm, yes, because in the tens place, I already counted 44 as part of 40-49, and now in the ones place, I'm counting it again. So, for the ones place, it's 9 numbers, but each contributes one 4, except 44 which contributes an extra. But since I'm just counting the number of 4's, each occurrence is counted separately. So, 9 occurrences in the ones place, regardless of whether the other digit is also a 4.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nNow, for three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down by hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, I need to consider how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: In the tens place, 4 can appear in any of the hundreds groups. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). However, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is still within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, except maybe the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But since 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, I think each hundred up to 300-399 will have 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and 400-488 will also have 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit cycles 0-8 in the tens place, so when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, four groups. Each group contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does that affect the count? Let me think. When the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 occurrences. So, yes, 4 groups, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nNow, the ones place: Similarly, in the ones place, 4 can appear in any position. For each hundred, in each set of ten numbers, the ones digit cycles 0-9, so in each ten numbers, there's one occurrence of 4 in the ones place. So, for each hundred, how many tens are there? Well, each hundred has 10 tens (0-9), so in each hundred, the ones digit 4 occurs 10 times (once per ten). But wait, let me clarify. For each hundred, like 100-199, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in 100-109, 104 has a 4 in the ones place. Similarly, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the ones place. So, for four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the ones place count? Let me check. For 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since it goes up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, so 484 would be the only one with a 4 in the ones place in that last ten. So, wait, does that mean that in the 400-488 range, the ones digit 4 occurs 9 times instead of 10? Because the last ten is incomplete. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, but the ones digit 4 occurs in 484, which is within 480-488, so that's one occurrence. So, actually, in each hundred, the ones digit 4 occurs 10 times, regardless of the upper limit, because the upper limit is beyond the 4 in the ones place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so in the 400-488 range, the ones digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, because after 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the ones digit 4 occurs 9 times, not 10. So, that means for the 400-488 group, the ones digit 4 occurs 9 times, while the other hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 occurrences. So, total ones digit 4's would be 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For 100-199: 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204,...,294 \u2192 10.\n\n300-399: 304,...,394 \u2192 10.\n\n400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484 \u2192 9 numbers.\n\nSo yes, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nSo, for the ones place in three-digit numbers, we have 39 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10, but in reality, the last hundred contributes 9. So, total ones digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOkay, so that's correct.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the number of 4's is:\n\nHundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTens place: 40 (from all four hundreds)\n\nOnes place: 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1+19 is 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8 is the only single-digit 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: again, tens and ones places.\n\nTens place: numbers from 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nOnes place: numbers ending with 8: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 +9=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: hundreds, tens, ones.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). But again, we have to consider the upper limit of 488.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: The tens digit 8 would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 +10 +10 +9 =39.\n\nOnes place: Similarly, in each hundred, the ones digit 8 occurs once per ten numbers. So, for each hundred, how many times does 8 appear in the ones place?\n\nFor 100-199: 108,118,128,...,198 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 208,...,298 \u219210.\n\n300-399:308,...,398\u219210.\n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, that's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total ones digit 8's: 10 +10 +10 +9=39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the number of 8's is:\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTens place:39\n\nOnes place:39\n\nTotal: 0 +39 +39=78.\n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again:1+19=20, plus78=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me verify the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page4)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:40-49\u219210\n\nOnes place:14,24,...,94\u21929\n\nTotal two-digit 4's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488\u219289\n\nTens place:40 numbers (10 per hundred for four hundreds)\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 40, but wait, in three-digit numbers, for the tens place, each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). But in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 per hundred, so 4*10=40.\n\nOnes place:39 (as calculated earlier)\n\nSo, hundreds:89, tens:40, ones:39 \u2192 total 168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, plus168=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:80-89\u219210\n\nOnes place:18,28,...,98\u21929\n\nTotal two-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:39\n\nOnes place:39\n\nTotal three-digit:78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, plus78=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, for the tens place of 4's, I considered 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Similarly, for 8's, I considered 4 hundreds, but in the case of 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 39 total for tens place.\n\nWait, but for 4's, in the tens place, all four hundreds contribute 10 each, including 400-488, which does have 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 100-199,200-299,300-399 each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 9, so 39.\n\nSame for ones place: 100-199,200-299,300-399 each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 9, so 39.\n\nSo, total 8's:39+39=78 in three-digit, plus 1+19=20, total 98.\n\n4's:89+40+39=168 in three-digit, plus1+19=20, total 188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place, the numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place, the numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. Wait, that's from 14 up by 10 each time until 94. Let me count: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, right? So, when I'm counting the units place, 44 contributes one 4, but in the tens place, it's already counted in the 40-49 range. So, I think I'm correct in adding 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 occurrences of 4 in two-digit numbers. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, so does that mean I'm double-counting? No, because in the tens place count, I'm considering all numbers where the tens digit is 4, regardless of the units digit. In the units place count, I'm considering all numbers where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, 44 is correctly counted twice because it has two 4's. So, that's correct. So, 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4 in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more involved. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: hundreds, tens, and units. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nFor the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Only in the numbers from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit page numbers. \n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For numbers 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, so the tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- For numbers 200-299: Similarly, tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n- For numbers 300-399: Tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n- For numbers 400-488: Tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so yes, 10 occurrences. So, adding these up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n- For 100-199: Units digit 4 occurs in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, units digit 4 occurs in 204,214,...,294. That's another 10 occurrences.\n- For 300-399: Units digit 4 occurs in 304,314,...,394. Another 10 occurrences.\n- For 400-488: Units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, let me count these. From 404 up by 10 each time until 484. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 484 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, adding these up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences of 4 in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. Okay, so 168 occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, I'll need to count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: 8 is one of them, so that's one occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Let's count 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, so in the units place count, 88 is included, contributing one 8 in the units place, but in the tens place count, it's already included in the 80-89 range. So, similar to the 4's, I think this is correct. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 8 in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers from 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nBreaking it down by hundreds:\n\n- 100-199: Tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Tens digit 8 occurs in 280-289, another 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: Tens digit 8 occurs in 380-389, another 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the units digit across three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, by hundreds:\n\n- 100-199: Units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Units digit 8 occurs in 208,218,...,298. That's another 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: Units digit 8 occurs in 308,318,...,398. Another 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let me count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds: 89 (correct, since 400-488 is 89 numbers)\n  - Tens: 40 (correct, 10 for each hundred except 400-488, which is 10)\n  - Units: 39 (correct, 10 for each hundred except 400-488, which is 9)\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 (correct)\n\nNow, checking the 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit:\n  - Tens: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 (correct)\n  - Units: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 (correct)\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 (correct)\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in three-digit numbers for 4's and 8's? Let me verify the three-digit counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's (correct)\n- Tens place: 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 for 400-488, but wait, 400-488 has 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, yes, 10 occurrences. So, 10+10+10+10=40 (correct)\n- Units place: For 100-199, 10 occurrences; same for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488, it's 9 occurrences because 484 is the last one. So, 10+10+10+9=39 (correct)\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 (correct)\n- Tens place: 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 for 400-488 (480-488), so 10+10+10+9=39 (correct)\n- Units place: 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 for 400-488 (408,418,...,488), so 10+10+10+9=39 (correct)\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider one-digit page numbers: 1-9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, ..., 49), so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers: The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 14, 24, 34, ..., up to 94. Let me count how many there are. From 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so there are 9 sets (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each set, 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but actually, from 10-99, the units digit 4 appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, right? So, 9 occurrences in the units place. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. \n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each of these places.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, pages 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Here, 4 can appear in the tens place regardless of the hundreds digit. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 140-149, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit can be 4, but the units digit goes up to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 doesn't affect the tens place. Wait, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences here as well.\n\nSo, total occurrences of 4 in the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, 4 can appear in the units place for each hundred. Let's go through each hundred.\n\nFor 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each ten, the units digit 4 appears once. There are 10 tens (00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99), so 10 occurrences in the units place for each hundred. So, 10 for 100-199.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: Another 10 occurrences.\n\n300-399: Another 10.\n\n400-488: Now, this is a bit different because the last page is 488. So, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Let me count how many that is. Starting from 404, each 10 numbers, so 404, 414, ..., 484. From 404 to 484, that's 9 numbers (since 484 - 404 = 80, which is 8 intervals, so 9 numbers). Wait, let me check: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nOne-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll go through the same process.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The units digit 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in the range x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n\nSo, for 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\n400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).\n\nSo, tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\n100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10.\n\n300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10.\n\n400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count these. From 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nOne-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. Okay.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit counts for 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, yes, 10 each for the first three hundreds and 10 for 400-488, so 40 total.\n\nUnits place: 10 for each of the first three hundreds, and 9 for 400-488, so 39 total.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, adding the two-digit and one-digit, 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 10 for each of the first three hundreds, and 9 for 400-488, so 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 for each of the first three hundreds, and 9 for 400-488, so 39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this result.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):** The digit 4 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49 gives 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 14, 24, ..., 94 gives 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 gives 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 each give 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n   - **Units place:** 108, 118, ..., 488 gives 10 occurrences for each hundred except 400-488, which gives 9.

Total: 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these sets contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the last set is 401-488. Each of the first four sets contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last set, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, wait. Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. So, units place: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 more in 481-488, so 49. Tens place: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), so that's another 10, making 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since our book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488 as the tens digit, but only for 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last set, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 8's printed: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted correctly in each place, especially the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, I considered that in the last set (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, in the last set, we have 9 8's in the tens place, which adds to the 40 from the first four sets, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: in the hundreds place, for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same calculation, 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 more in the last set (488), so 49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, we had 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe 90 is correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, pages 1-9: 9 pages, each with 1 digit: 9 digits.\n\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, each with 2 digits: 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages, each with 3 digits: 389 * 3 = 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 188 + 98 = 286 digits accounted for. That seems plausible, but maybe I can check if the counts make sense.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach: for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: as calculated, 49.\n\nFor 8's: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: 50.\n\nFor 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 89.\n\nFor 8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '4' in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488: 48 complete sets (480 numbers) + 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - '4's in units place: 48 (from sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Total sets of 100 in 488: 4 complete sets (400 numbers) + 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n   - '4's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40 (from sets) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '8' in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488: 48 complete sets + 8 extra numbers.\n   - '8's in units place: 48 (from sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total sets of 100 in 488: 4 complete sets (400 numbers) + 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n   - '8's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40 (from sets) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 1-488 have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers ending with 4 in the units place are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's one 4 in each of these numbers, so that's 9 fours. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, right? So, in the units place, we have 9 fours, but one of them is in 44, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, do I need to adjust for that? Hmm, maybe not, because when I count the tens place, I included all the 4's there, and when I count the units place, I include all the 4's there, regardless of whether they overlap. So, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 fours in the units place. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Again, the digits can be in the hundreds, tens, or units place. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But for the digit 4 in the hundreds place, it's only from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. \n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and similarly, the units digit can be 0-9. So, to count the number of 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, I need to consider how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nThe hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's consider each case:\n\n- When hundreds digit is 1: The tens digit can be 4, and the units digit can be anything from 0-9. So, that's 10 numbers (140-149). Each contributes one 4 in the tens place, so 10 fours.\n- Similarly, when hundreds digit is 2: The tens digit is 4, units from 0-9: 10 numbers (240-249). 10 fours.\n- When hundreds digit is 3: Tens digit 4, units 0-9: 10 numbers (340-349). 10 fours.\n- When hundreds digit is 4: Tens digit 4, units 0-9. But since the book ends at 488, the units digit can only go up to 8 when the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4, so the numbers would be 440-449, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 fours.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 fours.\n\nNow, the units place: For three-digit numbers, the units digit can be 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Again, considering hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: Tens digit can be 0-9, units digit 4. So, 10 numbers (104, 114, 124, ..., 194). 10 fours.\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 10 numbers (204, 214, ..., 294). 10 fours.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 numbers (304, 314, ..., 394). 10 fours.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Units digit 4, but the number can't exceed 488. So, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 484 is allowed, but 494 would be beyond 488). Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4, units digit is 4, so the numbers would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 494 would be 494, which is beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, 9 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4: the tens digit can be 0-8, so that's 9 numbers (0-8), hence 9 fours. So, yes, 39 fours in the units place.\n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours.\n\nNow, let's add up all the fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal fours = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, for three-digit numbers, the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTens place: for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 4*10=40 fours.\n\nUnits place: for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 fours, and for hundreds digit 4, it's 9 fours. So, 3*10 +9=39 fours.\n\nSo, 89 +40 +39=168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 +19=20. 20 +168=188 fours total.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: only page 8. So, one 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Again, count 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: numbers from 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: numbers ending with 8: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. Note that 88 has two 8's, but we're counting each occurrence, so 9 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 eights.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 can't be in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit can be 8. So, for each hundreds digit, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times (units 0-9). So, 4 hundreds digits, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place: 4*10=40 eights.\n\nUnits place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the units digit can be 8. So, for each hundreds digit, 10 numbers (tens 0-9), each contributing an 8 in the units place. So, 4*10=40 eights.\n\nWait, but we need to check if the page numbers go up to 488, so for hundreds digit 4, the units digit 8 is allowed only up to 488. So, when hundreds digit is 4 and units digit is 8, the tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 8: tens digit can be 0-8, which is 9 numbers (408,418,...,488). So, 9 eights instead of 10.\n\nWait, so let me adjust that. For units place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 eights (units digit 8, tens 0-9).\n- Hundreds digit 4: units digit 8, tens digit 0-8, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units place eights: 3*10 +9=39 eights.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: each contributes 10 eights (tens digit 8, units 0-9). But wait, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 would make the number 48X, where X is 0-9. But since the book ends at 488, when tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8. So, for hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8: units digits 0-8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 eights instead of 10.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 eights.\n- Hundreds digit 4: contributes 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 3*10 +9=39 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 4*10, but now I realize that for hundreds digit 4, it's only 9 eights in both tens and units places.\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place eights: 3*10 (for hundreds 1,2,3) +9 (for hundreds 4) =39.\n- Units place eights: 3*10 (for hundreds 1,2,3) +9 (for hundreds 4)=39.\n\nSo, total eights in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) +39 (units)=78 eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: tens 8, units 0-9: 10 numbers (180-189).\n- Hundreds digit 2: tens 8, units 0-9: 10 numbers (280-289).\n- Hundreds digit 3: tens 8, units 0-9: 10 numbers (380-389).\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens 8, units 0-8: 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, units place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: units 8, tens 0-9: 10 numbers (108,118,...,198).\n- Hundreds digit 2: units 8, tens 0-9: 10 numbers (208,218,...,298).\n- Hundreds digit 3: units 8, tens 0-9: 10 numbers (308,318,...,398).\n- Hundreds digit 4: units 8, tens 0-8: 9 numbers (408,418,...,488).\n\nSo, total units place eights: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total eights in three-digit numbers: 39+39=78 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal eights=1+19+78=98 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. Yes.\n\nSo, total fours:188, total eights:98.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours printed is 188 -98=90 more than the number of eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n- Three-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\nTotal fours:1+19+168=188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n- Three-digit:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the single-digit numbers, the only 4 is on page 4. Then, for two-digit numbers, every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra pages beyond the last complete decade. Let me calculate that. The total number of pages is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra pages. In each complete decade, 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the single-digit numbers, there's no tens digit, so we can ignore that. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. Each set of 100 pages will have 10 occurrences of each tens digit. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and so on. So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 is one, then each subsequent hundred adds another. Since 488 is less than 500, the last range is 440-449. So, that's five ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 times. But wait, in the hundreds place, each number contributes one digit, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Similar to the 4's, every 10 pages, 8 appears once. So, total number of complete decades is 48 (since 488/10=48.8), so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488-480+1=9). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo total for tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo yes, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98.\n\nWait, that's 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but wait, in the units place, we had 49, and in the tens place, 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let me recount. From 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? Every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, last term is 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The common difference is 10. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10=10n-6. Wait, maybe better to think of it as starting at 4, so the nth term is 4 +10(n-1). So, 484=4 +10(n-1). 480=10(n-1), so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 terms. That's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50. Let me see. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each: 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89. From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Same logic as 4's, except that in the last partial decade, 481-488, 8 appears at 488, so 49 in total. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49. Let me recount. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+49=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49, correct.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for single-digit page numbers (1-9), only page 4 has a 4. So that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. So, I'll count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's. \n\nFor the units place, the 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 10-19, it's 14; 20-29, it's 24; 30-39, it's 34; and 40-49, it's 44. Wait, but I've already counted the 4 in 44 in the tens place. But for the units place, each of these decades (10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) has one 4 in the units place. So that's 4 times, meaning 4 4's in the units place for two-digit numbers. \n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens place) + 4 (units place) = 14 4's. \n\nAdding the single-digit 4, the total so far is 1 + 14 = 15 4's. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These can be broken down into hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to count 4's in each place separately. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go from 400 to 488, so I need to be careful with the range there. \n\nStarting with hundreds place: \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Numbers from 100 to 199. The hundreds place is 1, so no 4's here.\n- For hundreds digit 2: Numbers from 200 to 299. Similarly, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 3: Numbers from 300 to 399. Again, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: Numbers from 400 to 488. Here, the hundreds place is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and for each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place exactly 10 times. But since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, I need to consider how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all hundreds. \n\nWait, but in our case, the hundreds digits go up to 4, and the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. But for the 400-488 range, the tens digit only goes up to 8 because 488 is the last page. Hmm, that complicates things a bit. Let me think. \n\nWait, actually, for each hundred block, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, and each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's in the tens place. \n\nBut for the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nWait, but 488 is included, so after 449, the tens digit goes up to 8, but we don't have a 450-459 in 400-488 because 488 is less than 499. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 400-488 can go up to 8, but for the tens digit being 4, it's only 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred, but in this case, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last number. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's only in the 440-449 range, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 4's in the tens place for the 400-488 range. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundred block, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. \n\nSo, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 units digits of 4. So that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 4's in the units place. \n\nFor the 400-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for each tens digit (0-8), the units digit can be 4 once. So, from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. So, how many numbers is that? Let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the units place for 400-488. \n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the units place, but in this case, since the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit only goes up to 8, the units digit 4 appears 9 times instead of 10. Hmm, that's because 488 is the last page, so when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, not 9. So, for the units digit 4, in the 400-488 range, it appears once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, which is 9 times. \n\nSo, total 4's in the units place across all three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 4's in the units place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (14) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 14 + 168 = 183 4's in total.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's go through the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9), only page 8 has an 8. So that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99). Again, I'll break this into tens and units places.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFor the units place, the 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 10-19, it's 18; 20-29, it's 28; 30-39, it's 38; 40-49, it's 48; 50-59, it's 58; 60-69, it's 68; 70-79, it's 78; 80-89, it's 88; 90-99, it's 98. Wait, but in the units place, each of these decades has one 8, except for 80-89, where we've already counted the 8 in the tens place. But for the units place, each decade from 10-19 up to 90-99 has exactly one number with an 8 in the units place. So that's 9 times, meaning 9 8's in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 10-99, how many numbers have an 8 in the units place? It's 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 8's.\n\nAdding the single-digit 8, the total so far is 1 + 19 = 20 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). Again, I'll consider hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Numbers from 100 to 199. The hundreds place is 1, so no 8's here.\n- For hundreds digit 2: Numbers from 200 to 299. Similarly, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 3: Numbers from 300 to 399. Again, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: Numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds place is 4, so no 8's here either.\n\nSo, total 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears exactly 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). \n\nSo, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 8's.\n\nFor the 400-488 range, the tens digit can go up to 8, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, but in 400-488, it's only 9 times because the units digit stops at 8. So, total 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred block, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 units digits of 8. So that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 8's in the units place.\n\nFor the 400-488 range, the units digit 8 appears once for each tens digit from 0 to 8. So, that's 9 times (408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488). So, 9 8's in the units place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the units place across all three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's in the units place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check: 39 in tens and 39 in units, so 39 + 39 = 78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit 8's: 20 (from 1-99) + 78 (from 100-488) = 98 8's in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 78. 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted the 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 39, and in units place also 39, so 78. Then adding the 20 from single and two-digit, it's 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the 400-488 range, when counting the tens place 8's, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Similarly, in the units place, it's 408, 418, etc., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's recap:\n\nNumber of 4's: 183\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nSo, the difference is 183 - 98 = 85.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 85 seems quite a big difference.\n\nWait, let me go through the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 4's\n- Units place: 4 in 14,24,34,44 \u2192 4 4's\nTotal two-digit: 14\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 4's\n- Tens place: 100-399 \u2192 3\u00d710=30; 400-488 \u2192 10 (440-449)\nTotal tens place: 40\n- Units place: 100-399 \u2192 3\u00d710=30; 400-488 \u2192 9 (404,414,...,484)\nTotal units place: 39\nSo, three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 14 + 168 = 183\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 8's\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u2192 9 8's\nTotal two-digit: 19\nThree-digit:\n- Tens place: 100-399 \u2192 3\u00d710=30; 400-488 \u2192 9 (480-488)\nTotal tens place: 39\n- Units place: 100-399 \u2192 3\u00d710=30; 400-488 \u2192 9 (408,418,...,488)\nTotal units place: 39\nSo, three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 183 - 98 = 85. So, there are 85 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I counted the units place 8's in 400-488, I included 488, which is correct. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 is correct.\n\nHmm, I think the counts are accurate. So, the answer should be 85 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 183, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 183 - 98 = 85.\n\n$\\boxed{85}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, I'll look at two-digit page numbers, from 10 to 99. Here, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nStarting with the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nNow, for the units place: The digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, in the range 10-99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times. So, for each ten numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. That would be 9 times (from 10-99) because 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99. Wait, actually, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten. But wait, from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\nWait, but hold on, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each ten numbers, there's one 4. So, 10-19: 14, 20-29: 24, and so on up to 90-99: 94. That's 9 times. So, in the two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, totaling 19 times. \n\nWait, but hold on, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Then, in the units place, from 10-99, it's 9 times. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's consider each case.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1: 100-199. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place here? It doesn't; the hundreds digit is 1, so 0 times.\n- Hundreds digit = 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so 0 times.\n- Hundreds digit = 3: 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so 0 times.\n- Hundreds digit = 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place: In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit = 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times: 140-149. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit = 2 (200-299): The tens digit 4 appears in 240-249, which is another 10 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit = 3 (300-399): Tens digit 4 appears in 340-349, another 10 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit = 4 (400-488): Now, here, the tens digit can go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. However, wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 10 times.\n\nAdding these up: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, in three-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1 (100-199): For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 tens in a hundred, so 10 occurrences. But wait, 100-199 has 100 numbers, so 100/10 = 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\n- Similarly, hundreds digit = 2 (200-299): 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 3 (300-399): 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 4 (400-488): Now, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in 400-488, the number of complete tens is 8 (since 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 8 full decades (each of 10 numbers) and then 9 extra numbers (480-488). So, in each full decade, the units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times. Then, in the last partial decade (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, so 484 is the only number with a units digit 4. So, that's 1 more occurrence. So, total of 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nAdding up all the units place occurrences: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nTotal in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let's go through the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: In each set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once per ten numbers. From 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, ..., 90-99). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in 10-99, the units digit 8 appears in 18, 28, ..., 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. \n\n- Hundreds digit =1: 100-199. 8 in hundreds place? No, so 0.\n- Hundreds digit=2: 200-299. 8 in hundreds place? No, 0.\n- Hundreds digit=3: 300-399. 8 in hundreds place? No, 0.\n- Hundreds digit=4: 400-488. 8 in hundreds place? No, since hundreds digit is 4. So, 0 occurrences in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, in the tens place, 8 can appear in three-digit numbers as follows:\n\n- For hundreds digit=1 (100-199): The tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit=2 (200-299): 280-289, 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit=3 (300-399): 380-389, 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit=4 (400-488): Now, the tens digit can go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place 8's:\n\n10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Now, in the units place, 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit=1 (100-199): For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once per ten. There are 10 tens in 100-199, so 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit=2 (200-299): Similarly, 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit=3 (300-399): 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit=4 (400-488): Now, from 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, ..., 480-488). Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 8 full decades (each 10 numbers) and then 9 extra numbers (480-488). In each full decade, the units digit 8 appears once, so 8 times. In the last partial decade (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in 480-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total of 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the units place 8's:\n\n10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 8 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. Yes.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94) \u2192 19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 (correct)\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) \u2192 Wait, earlier I thought 400-488 in tens place 8's was 9, but for 4's in tens place, it's 10 because 440-449 is a full set of 10. So, 10 for each hundred, so 40 total (correct)\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39 (correct)\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168, plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 (correct)\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98) \u2192 19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 0 (correct)\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39 (correct)\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39 (correct)\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78, plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 (correct)\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers when counting 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the units place for three-digit numbers, for hundreds digit=4 (400-488), how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\nFrom 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each set of ten, 8 appears once. How many complete sets of ten are there in 400-488?\n\n488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. 89 divided by 10 is 8 complete sets (each of 10 numbers) and 9 remaining numbers. So, in each complete set, 8 appears once in the units place, so 8 times. Then, in the remaining 9 numbers (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 488 is included, which has units digit 8. So, that's 1 more occurrence. So, total of 8 + 1 = 9 times. So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place in three-digit numbers, hundreds digit=4 (400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the units place? \n\nSame calculation: 8 complete sets of ten (400-488 is 89 numbers, so 8 full decades), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 8 times. Then, in the remaining 9 numbers (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is one more occurrence. So, total of 8 + 1 = 9 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, the counts for 4's and 8's seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I should count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, the last one is 94. Let me count: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\nWait, but hold on, 44 has a 4 in both tens and units place. So, when I count the tens place, I included 44, and when I count the units place, I also included 44. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. \n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated. Let me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4. \n\nNow, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For the tens digit, I need to consider each hundred separately. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nFor hundreds digit 1: The tens digit can be 0-9, so 140-149 is the range where tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 240-249, another 10 occurrences. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 340-349, another 10 occurrences. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 440-449, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. That's another 10 occurrences. \n\nSo, total occurrences of 4 in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for hundreds digit 1: 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294. Another 10. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394. Another 10. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Now, from 400 to 488. The units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. Let me count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total occurrences of 4 in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (89 + 40 + 39). Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I've already broken down the hundreds, tens, and units places. So, the hundreds place contributes 89, the tens place 40, and the units place 39. So, total for three-digit numbers is 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nThen, adding the single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total number of 4's is 20 + 168 = 188. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 168. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. That seems correct. \n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process. \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 8 is one of them, so 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Now, I need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens and units places. \n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: Numbers like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 88 has an 8 in both tens and units, so when I count the tens place, I included 88, and when I count the units place, I included it again. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Again, hundreds, tens, units places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, no, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, as the book has 488 pages. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences there. \n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit can be 8. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, the tens digit 8 occurs in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. \n\nSo, for hundreds digit 1: 180-189 is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 280-289, another 10. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 380-389, another 10. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 480-488. Let's see, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total occurrences of 8 in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nUnits place: Now, for each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. \n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 208, 218, 228, 238, 248, 258, 268, 278, 288, 298. Another 10. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 308, 318, 328, 338, 348, 358, 368, 378, 388, 398. Another 10. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 498 would be beyond 488. \n\nSo, total occurrences of 8 in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 8: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (39 + 39). Wait, no, in three-digit numbers, the tens place contributes 39 and the units place contributes 39, so total for three-digit is 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nThen, adding the single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 gives 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So, 1 + 19 = 20, 20 +78=98. That seems correct. \n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each part again quickly. \n\nFor 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. Total 188. \n\nFor 8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. Total 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nHmm, that seems right. I think I've accounted for all the digits correctly. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears exactly once here, which is on page 4. So, single-digit numbers contribute 1 four.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Now, in two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I should count the number of times 4 appears in both places separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the range 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such sets (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 fours from the units place.\n\nAdding these together for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to consider each place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The numbers from 400 to 488 all have a 4 in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 fours from the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred (like 100-199, 200-299, etc.), the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nBut wait, we have to consider up to 488, so let's break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these will have a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 10 fours for each hundred, and there are 3 such hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). That gives 3 * 10 = 30 fours.\n\n- For the hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can be 0-8, so when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, contributing 10 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40 fours.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. For each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the units place for each ten. So, in each hundred, there are 10 fours in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199). \n\nAgain, considering up to 488:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 fours in the units place, so 3 * 10 = 30 fours.\n\n- For the hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the digit 4 appears once in each ten, but how many tens are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. The units digit cycles every 10, so 8 full cycles (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the units digit 4 would appear once in 484. So, actually, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times, but for the last partial hundred, it might be less. Wait, let's correct this.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last ten is 480-488). So, how many full tens are there? From 400 to 480, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489), but since we're only going up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each of the first 8 tens (400-409 up to 470-479), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, that's 8 fours. Then, in 480-488, the digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total fours in the units place for 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 fours.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each ten from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489 would have a units digit of 4 once per ten. But since we're only going up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, that's 8 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 8 fours. Then, in 480-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's 1 more. So, total of 9 fours in the units place for 400-488.\n\nTherefore, total fours in the units place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 per hundred, but for 400-488, it's only 9. So, perhaps I should adjust. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of units digit 4's in each hundred.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the units place calculation. Let me try another approach. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 10 per hundred, except for the last one which is cut off at 488. So, 100-199: 10 fours (104, 114, ..., 194). Similarly, 200-299: 10 fours. 300-399: 10 fours. Now, 400-488: How many fours in the units place? The units digit cycles 0-9 every ten. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, up to 480-489, but we stop at 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many units digit 4's? In each full ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), that's 8 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 8 fours. Then, in 480-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more. So, total of 9 fours in the units place for 400-488.\n\nTherefore, total fours in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 30 + 9 = 39, which matches. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours\n- Tens place: 40 fours\n- Units place: 39 fours\n\nTotal fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours.\n\nNow, let's add up all the fours from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in each place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, single-digit numbers contribute 1 eight.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99). Again, considering tens and units places separately.\n\nTens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: In each set of ten numbers (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit is 8 once. There are 9 such sets (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 eights.\n\nTotal eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers (100-488). Again, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nTens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 8. Let's see how many times this happens.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) will have a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 10 eights per hundred, and 3 hundreds, so 3 * 10 = 30 eights.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nTotal eights in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nUnits place: Now, the units digit is 8. Let's count how many times this happens in three-digit numbers.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has numbers ending with 8 once every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, there are 10 eights in the units place (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198 in 100-199). So, 10 per hundred, 3 hundreds, so 3 * 10 = 30 eights.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit cycles 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each ten, the units digit 8 appears once. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, ..., 470-479) and a partial ten (480-488). In each full ten, the units digit 8 appears once, so 8 eights. In the partial ten, 480-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488, so that's 1 more. So, total of 8 + 1 = 9 eights in the units place for 400-488.\n\nTherefore, total eights in the units place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nSo, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 eights\n- Tens place: 39 eights\n- Units place: 39 eights\n\nTotal eights in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 78. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the counts again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39. Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- Total fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19\n- Three-digit: tens place: 39, units place: 39. Total: 78\n- Total eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit numbers for fours. Let me check the units place again for three-digit numbers. For 400-488, I thought there were 9 fours in the units place, but let me list them out:\n\n400-409: 404\n410-419: 414\n420-429: 424\n430-439: 434\n440-449: 444 (but wait, 440-449 is part of the tens place, but in the units place, 444 is counted here. Wait, no, in the units place, it's the last digit. So, in 400-409, units digit 4 is at 404. Similarly, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place in three-digit numbers had 40 fours. Let me check that again.\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 fours.\n- Total: 30 + 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nUnits place: 39 fours as calculated.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n- Tens place: 39 eights (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 eights (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\n- Total: 78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Total eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, fours: 188, eights: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in counting problems, it's easy to miss or double-count. Let me try an alternative approach by considering each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once. So, the number of blocks is 488 // 10 = 48 full blocks, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full block, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484.\n\nSo, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 fours in total, which included units, tens, and hundreds. Wait, maybe this approach is conflicting with my previous method. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the digit places. Let me try to calculate each digit place separately.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as follows:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nAs above, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and the last partial ten (481-488) contributes one more 4 (at 484). So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in units place:\n\nSame method. 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the last partial ten (481-488) contributes one more 8 (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in my previous calculation, I had only 39 eights in the units place for three-digit numbers, but this approach suggests 49 eights in units place overall. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the previous approach, I broke down the counts for each digit place across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. But perhaps that's where the error occurred.\n\nLet me try this alternative method where I calculate each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nAs each ten has one 4 in the units place, so 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which has a 4 in the units place. So, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in units place:\n\nEach ten has one 8 in the units place, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the remaining 8 numbers include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the per-digit-place counting, I had different numbers. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous method. Let's check.\n\nIn the previous method, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place fours: 39\n- Units place eights: 39\n\nBut according to this method, units place fours are 49, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. So, perhaps the previous method was incorrect.\n\nWait, let's see. The units place fours:\n\n- Single-digit: page 4, so 1\n- Two-digit: 10-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94)\n- Three-digit: 100-488, units digit 4 appears how many times?\n\nIn 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 times\n200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times\n300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times\n400-488: 404,414,...,484: 9 times (since 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488)\n\nSo, units place fours in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 9\nThree-digit: 39\nTotal units place fours: 1 + 9 + 39 = 50\n\nWait, but according to the alternative method, it's 49. There's a discrepancy here. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the two-digit numbers, from 10-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94). That's correct.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n100-199: 10 fours\n200-299: 10 fours\n300-399: 10 fours\n400-488: 9 fours\nTotal: 39 fours\n\nSo, units place fours: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 50\n\nBut according to the alternative method, it's 49. Hmm, perhaps the alternative method is wrong because it's considering 488 as the last number, but in the three-digit numbers, 400-488 includes 484, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the alternative method is not accounting for something. Let me check.\n\nWait, the alternative method counts 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and one more in the last partial ten. So, 48 + 1 = 49. But according to the detailed count, it's 50. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the alternative method is missing something. Let me list out the units digit 4's:\n\nFrom 1-9: 4 (1)\nFrom 10-99: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 (9)\nFrom 100-199: 104,114,...,194 (10)\nFrom 200-299: 204,214,...,294 (10)\nFrom 300-399: 304,314,...,394 (10)\nFrom 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484 (9)\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 50\n\nSo, the correct count is 50 units place fours. Therefore, the alternative method was wrong because it counted 48 full tens, but in reality, from 1-488, the number of full tens is 48 (1-480), and then 481-488 is 8 numbers. But in 1-480, the units digit 4 appears 48 times (48 full tens), and in 481-488, it appears once at 484, so total 49. But according to the detailed count, it's 50. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the alternative method is not considering that 488 is included, but 484 is within 481-488. So, 48 full tens (1-480) contribute 48 fours, and 484 contributes one more, totaling 49. But the detailed count shows 50. Therefore, the alternative method is missing one.\n\nWait, perhaps because 488 is included, but in the units place, 488 has an 8, not a 4. So, in 481-488, the units digit 4 is only at 484, so that's one. So, 48 + 1 = 49. But the detailed count shows 50. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the detailed count.\n\nWait, let me recount the units place fours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u2192 9\nThree-digit:\n100-199: 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194 \u2192 10\n200-299: 204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294 \u219210\n300-399: 304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394 \u219210\n400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484 \u21929\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 50\n\nBut according to the alternative method, it's 49. So, perhaps the alternative method is undercounting by one. Wait, maybe because 488 is included, but the units digit 4 in 484 is correctly counted. So, perhaps the alternative method is correct, and the detailed count is overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps in the three-digit numbers, 400-488, the units digit 4 appears at 404,414,...,484, which is 9 times, as 404 is the first in 400-488, and 484 is the last. So, 9 numbers. Then, in 1-480, units digit 4 appears 48 times, and in 481-488, once. So, total 48 + 1 + 9 = 58? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the counts. Let me try a different approach. The total number of units digit 4's from 1-488 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is once every 10 numbers. So, total numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10): 488 // 10 = 48, with a remainder of 8.\n\nEach complete decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours.\n\nThen, in the incomplete decade (481-488), we check if there's a units digit 4. 484 is within this range, so that's one more.\n\nSo, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nBut according to the detailed count earlier, it's 50. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the detailed count is correct because in the three-digit numbers, from 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times, and from 1-399, units digit 4 appears 40 times (1-9:1, 10-99:9, 100-399:30). So, 1 + 9 + 30 = 40, plus 9 in 400-488, total 49. Wait, that adds up to 49, not 50. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the detailed count earlier by adding an extra 1 somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 9\n- Three-digit:\n  - 100-399: 30\n  - 400-488:9\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 30 +9 = 50\n\nBut according to the units place calculation, it's 49. So, perhaps the three-digit numbers from 100-399 contribute 30 units digit fours, and from 400-488, 9, so 39. Then, single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 9 = 10. Total: 39 +10=49. That's consistent with the units place calculation.\n\nWait, so perhaps earlier, when I was calculating the units place fours in three-digit numbers, I had 39, but in the detailed count, I had 50, which was incorrect. So, the correct count is 49 units place fours.\n\nSimilarly, for units place eights:\n\nUsing the same method:\n\nFrom 1-488, units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights.\n\nIn the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digit 8 appears at 488, so one more.\n\nTotal units place eights: 48 +1 = 49.\n\nBut according to the detailed count earlier, I had:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:9\n- Three-digit:39\nTotal:1 +9 +39=50\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the detailed count for units place eights:\n\n- Single-digit: page 8 \u21921\n- Two-digit:18,28,...,98 \u21929\n- Three-digit:\n  - 100-199:108,118,...,198 \u219210\n  - 200-299:208,218,...,298 \u219210\n  - 300-399:308,318,...,398 \u219210\n  - 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488 \u21929\nTotal:1 +9 +10 +10 +10 +9=50\n\nBut according to the alternative method, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, from 400-488, units digit 8 appears at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:9\n- Three-digit:10 +10 +10 +9=39\nTotal:1 +9 +39=50\n\nBut according to the alternative method, it's 49. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the alternative method, it's considering 488 as part of the incomplete decade, but 488 is included in the count. So, 48 full decades contribute 48 eights, and the last partial decade (481-488) contributes one more at 488, so total 49.\n\nBut according to the detailed count, it's 50. So, there's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's list out the units digit eights:\n\nFrom 1-9:8 \u21921\nFrom 10-99:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u21929\nFrom 100-199:108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198 \u219210\nFrom 200-299:208,218,228,238,248,2"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears only once, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in each position.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 instances of the digit 4. \n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers: The 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 10-19, it's page 14; in 20-29, it's page 24; and so on up to 90-99, which is page 94. That's 9 instances, but wait, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 times. Wait, but 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 instances of 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nWait, let me check: from 10 to 99, the tens digits from 1 to 9, so 40-49 is 10 numbers, and for units digit, each ten has one 4, so 9 instances. So, 10 + 9 = 19. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, each number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to count the number of 4's in each position.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: From 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so no 4's there. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: I need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 instances.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 240-249, another 10 instances.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 340-349, another 10 instances.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can be 0-8, since 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 instances. However, wait, 488 is the end, so from 400 to 488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 instances. \n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 440-449 is okay. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times for each hundred (1,2,3,4). So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 instances. That's 4*10=40 instances. Wait, but let me check: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. So, 40 instances in total for the tens place.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 40 in total.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Here, 4 can appear in the units digit. Let's count how many times this happens from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), in each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each has 100 numbers, so 10 instances each (e.g., 104,114,...,194; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3*10=30 instances.\n\nFor hundreds 4 (400-488): Now, how many numbers are there here? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every ten numbers, so from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, starting at 400, 404,414,...,484. Let's see how many there are.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 instances because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 484 is included, so that's 9 times? Wait, 404 is the first, then adding 10 each time: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 instances.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=39 instances.\n\nWait, but let me check: For each hundred from 100-399, each has 10 instances, so 3*10=30. For 400-488, it's 9 instances because 484 is the last one before 488, which is 488-400=88, so 88/10=8.8, so 9 instances. So, 30+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39)=89+40=129+39=168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens)=129, plus 39 (units)=168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's=1+19=20+168=188.\n\nWait, 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 instances of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: In each set of ten (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 10-19:18, 20-29:28,...,90-99:98. That's 9 instances.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 instances.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's count:\n\nFor 100-199:180-189, 10 numbers.\n\nFor 200-299:280-289,10 numbers.\n\nFor 300-399:380-389,10 numbers.\n\nFor 400-488:480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 instances.\n\nSo, total in tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 100-488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), in each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers.\n\nFor 100-199:108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:208,218,...,298:10 numbers.\n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10 numbers.\n\n400-488:408,418,...,488. Now, how many here? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. Wait, 408 to 488 with step 10: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units digit 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's=1+19=20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49=10, units place 14,24,...,94=9, total 19 (correct).\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488=89 numbers (correct).\n\nTens place:10 each for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 10 for 400-488 (since 440-449 is within 400-488), so 4*10=40 (correct).\n\nUnits place:10 each for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 for 400-488, so 3*10 +9=39 (correct).\n\nTotal 4's:89+40+39=168 in three-digit, plus 1+19=20, total 188 (correct).\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89=10, units place 18,28,...,98=9, total 19 (correct).\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:180-189,280-289,380-389 each have 10, and 480-488 has 9, so 10+10+10+9=39 (correct).\n\nUnits place:10 each for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 for 400-488, so 3*10 +9=39 (correct).\n\nTotal 8's:39+39=78 in three-digit, plus 1+19=20, total 98 (correct).\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the tens place can be from 1 to 9, and the units place can be from 0 to 9. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: numbers like 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: in every block of ten numbers, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94). Since there are 9 blocks (10-99), that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nNow, adding the single-digit occurrence, the total number of 4's so far is 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. \n\nNext, I need to consider the three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. \n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's break this down. \n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: Pages 100-199. Here, the hundreds place is 1, so no 4's there. \n- Hundreds digit is 2: Pages 200-299. Again, hundreds place is 2, so no 4's. \n- Hundreds digit is 3: Pages 300-399. Hundreds place is 3, no 4's. \n- Hundreds digit is 4: Pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds place is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in the 140-149 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (140-149). That's 10 occurrences. \n- Similarly, for 200-299: 240-249, another 10 occurrences. \n- For 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences. \n- For 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 440-449 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 occurrences. \n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, we have 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences of 4. \n\nNow, for the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred block, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place every ten numbers. \n\n- For 100-199: In each ten numbers (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit is 4 once per block. There are 10 blocks (0-9 in the tens place), so 10 occurrences. \n- Similarly, for 200-299: 10 occurrences. \n- For 300-399: 10 occurrences. \n- For 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because 400-488 isn't a full hundred. Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, how many full tens are there? From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, for each tens digit (0-8), the units digit 4 appears once. That's 9 occurrences (since 0-8 is 9 tens places). \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400-488, the units digit 4 would appear in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, adding up the units place occurrences: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. \n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we have 10 each, so 40 total. \n\nIn the units place, 10 each for the first three hundred blocks, and 9 for the last, so 39 total. \n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers. \n\nAdding that to the two-digit and single-digit numbers: 20 (from 1-99) + 168 (from 100-488) = 188 total 4's. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process. \n\nSingle-digit page numbers: from 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10-99. Again, count 8's in the tens place and units place. \n\nTens place: numbers like 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: in every block of ten numbers, like 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (e.g., 18, 28, ..., 98). There are 9 blocks (10-99), so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nAdding the single-digit occurrence, the total number of 8's so far is 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: from 100-488. Again, considering hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: Pages 100-199. No 8's in the hundreds place. \n- Hundreds digit is 2: Pages 200-299. No 8's. \n- Hundreds digit is 3: Pages 300-399. No 8's. \n- Hundreds digit is 4: Pages 400-488. No 8's in the hundreds place because 8 is less than 4, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's here. \n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred block, we look for 8's in the tens place. \n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in the 180-189 range, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (180-189). That's 10 occurrences. \n- Similarly, for 200-299: 280-289, another 10 occurrences. \n- For 300-399: 380-389, another 10 occurrences. \n- For 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, we have 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences of 8. \n\nNow, for the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred block, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred block, the digit 8 appears once in the units place every ten numbers. \n\n- For 100-199: In each ten numbers (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit is 8 once per block. There are 10 blocks (0-9 in the tens place), so 10 occurrences. \n- Similarly, for 200-299: 10 occurrences. \n- For 300-399: 10 occurrences. \n- For 400-488: The units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, adding up the units place occurrences: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences of 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, summing up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78. \n\nAdding that to the two-digit and single-digit numbers: 20 (from 1-99) + 78 (from 100-488) = 98 total 8's. \n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit 8's. \n\nIn the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. \n\nIn the units place: same as tens place, 39. \n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nSo, total 8's: 20 (from 1-99) + 78 = 98. \n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the number of 4's was 188 and 8's was 98, so the difference is 90. \n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nLet me recount the 4's. \n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place (40-49: 10) + units place (14,24,...,94: 9) = 19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place (400-488: 89) + tens place (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 40) + units place (100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9) = 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit. \n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\nFor 8's: \n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place (80-89:10) + units place (18,28,...,98:9) =19. \n\nThree-digit: tens place (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 10+10+10+9=39) \n\nUnits place (100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9) =39. \n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +39+39=98. \n\nWait, hold on, in three-digit numbers, the 8's in tens and units places are both 39 each, so 78, plus the two-digit and single-digit 20, so total 98. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full groups, plus one more time in the last partial group (pages 481-488, where 484 has a 4 in the units place). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, 4 appears in a block of ten pages. For example, in the 40-49 range, each page has a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, each group of ten has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full groups and 8 extra pages. In the units place, 8 appears 48 times from the full groups. In the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in blocks of ten pages. These would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488). Each full block gives 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The partial block from 480-488 has 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all these pages, contributing 9 more 8's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: these range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: in every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets (10-19 up to 90-99), but wait, actually, from 10 to 99, that's 9 decades (10s, 20s,...,90s). In each decade, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once per decade. So, 9 occurrences in the units place. \n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, it's 90 numbers, which is 9 decades. So, 9 times 1 is 9. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: the numbers from 100 to 399 have 1, 2, or 3 in the hundreds place. The 400s go up to 488, so from 400 to 488. \n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers: I need to consider each hundred separately. \n\nFrom 100-199: the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. Same for 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. And in 400-488: the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 440-449 is included. So, for each hundred except the last one (400-488), we have 10 occurrences in the tens place, and in the last hundred, we also have 10. So, total for tens place: 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 3*10=30, plus the 400-488 contributing another 10, so total 40. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, but when I'm considering the tens place across all three-digit numbers, I should consider each hundred separately. So, 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit cycles through 0-8, so 440-449 is indeed 10 numbers. So, yes, 40 occurrences in the tens place. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: again, considering each hundred. \n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. \n\nFrom 100-199: 104,114,124,...,194: 10 numbers. \n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10. \n\n300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10. \n\n400-488: Now, here, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 400-488? Let's see: starting at 404, each 10 numbers, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let me check: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, total units place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168. \n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20+168=188. So, total 4's: 188. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. \n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. \n\nTens place: numbers 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: in each decade (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 decades, so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. \n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. \n\nTens place: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488: the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)= 39. \n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: in each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199: 108,118,...,198:10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299:208,218,...,298:10. 300-399:308,318,...,398:10. 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting at 408, each 10 numbers. 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78. \n\nAdding up all 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78)=1+19=20+78=98. \n\nSo, total 8's:98. \n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nCounting 4's: \n- Single-digit:1 \n- Two-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 \n- Three-digit:89 (hundreds)+40 (tens)+39 (units)=168 \nTotal:1+19+168=188. \n\nCounting 8's: \n- Single-digit:1 \n- Two-digit:10 (tens)+9 (units)=19 \n- Three-digit:0 (hundreds)+39 (tens)+39 (units)=78 \nTotal:1+19+78=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 4 appears once in each ten (14, 24, ..., 94) \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 40 occurrences.\n     - Units place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u2192 10 each, and in 400-488 \u2192 9 (since 484 is the last).

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, single-digit: 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. For the tens place, the 4 can appear in the tens digit, which would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49), so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place, the 4 can appear in any of the two-digit numbers where the units digit is 4. These would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but wait, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 9 times (since 44 is already counted in the tens place, but actually, no, in the units place, it's 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 44 has both tens and units as 4, so when counting units place, it's 9 occurrences. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 10-99, tens place: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total 19 times in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Here, the page numbers can be broken down into hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to consider each place separately for the digit 4.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but for 4, it's only up to 488, so 400-488.\n\nSo, for hundreds place:\n\n- When hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. Here, 4 can appear in tens or units places, but not in hundreds. So, no 4's in the hundreds place here.\n\n- When hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, no 4's in hundreds place.\n\n- When hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, no 4's in hundreds place.\n\n- When hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, in each hundred block (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit is 4 in the range x40-x49, where x is the hundreds digit. \n\nSo, let's consider each hundred block:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait a second. For 400-488, the tens digit being 4 is from 440-449, which is indeed 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. So, yes, 40 in total.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred block, for each ten's group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), let's calculate:\n\n- 100-199: 10 occurrences (104,114,124,...,194)\n- 200-299: 10 occurrences\n- 300-399: 10 occurrences\n- 400-488: Now, 400-488 is 89 numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many full decades are there? 400-488 is 89 numbers. 89 divided by 10 is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419,...,480-489, but wait, 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 occurrences because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 484 is within 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 484 is the 5th number in that last partial decade. So, total in 400-488: 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let's see: from 400 to 488, how many full decades? 400-409: 10 numbers, 410-419:10, ..., 480-488:9. So, from 400-480, that's 80 numbers, which is 8 full decades, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. Then, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, we have 484 as the only occurrence. So, total in 400-488: 8 +1 =9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm. Each hundred block from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 has 10 units place 4's. The 400-488 block has 9 units place 4's. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers:39.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) =20, plus 168 (three-digit) gives 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal in two-digit:10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers:100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place:0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 in x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n\nSo, for 100-199:180-189:10 occurrences.\n\n200-299:280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred block, the units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers.\n\nFor 100-199:108,118,...,198:10 occurrences.\n\n200-299:208,218,...,298:10.\n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10.\n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 =78.\n\nNow, total 8's in the entire book:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, let me add that again:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89\n\n- Tens place:10+10+10+10=40\n\n- Units place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place:10+10+10+9=39\n\n- Units place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total:** 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in ranges like 140-149, etc. \u2192 10 per block \u00d7 4 blocks = 40.\n   - **Units place:** In each hundred block, units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nStarting with the tens place: The tens digit can be 4, and the units digit can be any digit from 0 to 9. So, the pages would be 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 fours. \n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit can be 4, and the tens digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since we're considering two-digit numbers). So, the pages would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers. Wait, but 44 has already been counted in the tens place. So, does that mean I should count 44 only once? Hmm, but when counting digits, each occurrence of 4 in any position is counted separately. So, in 44, both the tens and units digits are 4, so each contributes to the count. So, actually, the units place 4's in two-digit numbers would include 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 9 fours. \n\nWait, but 44 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, we have 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 fours. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the units place, 44 is counted once, and in the tens place, it's also counted once. So, the total number of fours in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm double-counting it? Hmm, but when counting digits, each digit is counted separately. So, in 44, there are two 4's, so it's correct to count both. So, 10 in the tens place and 9 in the units place, but 44 contributes two 4's, so the total is 10 + 9 = 19 fours in two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but if I think about it, from 10 to 99, the tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, and the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, there are 10 numbers (40-49), each contributing one 4. For the units digit being 4, there are 9 numbers (14,24,...,94), each contributing one 4. So, total of 19 fours in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. \n\nLet's break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds digit being 4: Pages 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit can be 1-4, but let's focus on when the tens digit is 4. \n\nSo, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit is 4, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nSo, for hundreds digit 1: 140-149 (10 numbers) \nHundreds digit 2: 240-249 (10 numbers) \nHundreds digit 3: 340-349 (10 numbers) \nHundreds digit 4: 440-449 (10 numbers) \n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 would go up to 449, which is within 488. So, each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. \n\nWait, but wait: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 fours in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: The units digit can be 4, and the hundreds and tens digits can be any valid digits. \n\nSo, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), and each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 4. \n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: each has 10 tens digits (0-9), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 numbers where the units digit is 4. \n\nBut wait, we have to check if 488 is included. The units digit 4 in 488 would be in the hundreds place? Wait, no, 488 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). So, the units digit 4 in three-digit numbers would be up to 488, but since 488's units digit is 8, the last number with units digit 4 is 484. So, does that affect the count? \n\nWait, let me think. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each hundreds digit, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, each has 10 possibilities for tens digits, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 numbers where the units digit is 4. \n\nBut wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8, because the book ends at 488. So, does that affect the count? Let me check. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, when the units digit is 4, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits can be 0-8, which is 9 possibilities, not 10. So, for hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times (404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10, but actually, since the book ends at 488, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so for hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times, not 10. \n\nSo, let me adjust that. For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each can have tens digits 0-9, so 10 each, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. For hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. For hundreds digit 1: 104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers. Similarly for 2 and 3. For 4: 404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers, as 494 would be beyond 488. So, yes, 39 fours in the units place for three-digit numbers. \n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers: hundreds place contributes 89 fours, tens place contributes 40 fours, and units place contributes 39 fours. So, total fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place: 89 fours. Tens place: for each hundreds digit 1,2,3,4, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each (except for hundreds digit 4, which only goes up to 488, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so actually, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). Wait, but earlier I thought that the tens digit 4 for hundreds digit 4 would be 10 numbers, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, all within 488. So, actually, the tens place for three-digit numbers should be 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours, as I initially thought. \n\nSimilarly, for the units place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each can have 10 tens digits (0-9), so 10 each, totaling 30. For hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times (as the tens digit can only go up to 8, so 404,414,...,484). So, units place: 30 + 9 = 39 fours. \n\nSo, three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 fours. \n\nNow, let's add up all the fours: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nSingle-digit: 4 \u2192 1 four. \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u2192 9 fours. So, 10 + 9 = 19 fours. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 400-488 \u2192 89 fours. Tens place: for each hundreds digit 1,2,3,4, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Units place: for hundreds digits 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30. For hundreds digit 4: 9. So, 30 + 9 = 39 fours. \n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours. \n\nAdding up: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): the only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99): \n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 8, so pages 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights. \n\nUnits place: The units digit can be 8, and the tens digit can be any digit from 1 to 9. So, the pages would be 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 88 has both tens and units digits as 8, so each occurrence is counted separately. So, units place contributes 9 eights. \n\nSo, two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights. \n\nWait, but 88 is included in both counts, so in total, we have 10 + 9 = 19 eights in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers (100-488): \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, when the hundreds digit is 8, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's. \n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 8, and the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. For each hundreds digit, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times (units digit 0-9). So, 4 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: The units digit can be 8, and the hundreds and tens digits can be any valid digits. For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), and each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 8. So, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the units place. \n\nBut wait, let's check if the book ends at 488, so for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can go up to 8, but the units digit can still be 8 even if the tens digit is 8. So, for example, 488 is included, so the units digit 8 occurs in 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the units digit 8 occurs 9 times (since tens digits go up to 8). Wait, no, actually, the units digit 8 occurs once for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 tens digits (0-9), so 10 each, totaling 30. For hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8 (since 488 is the last page), so 9 tens digits, each with units digit 8. So, 9 eights. So, total units place eights: 30 + 9 = 39 eights. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Let me clarify. \n\nFor units digit 8 in three-digit numbers: \n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each can have tens digits 0-9, so 10 each, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. \n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9, each with units digit 8. So, 9 eights. \nTotal: 30 + 9 = 39 eights in the units place. \n\nSimilarly, for tens place in three-digit numbers: \n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: each can have tens digit 8, with units digits 0-9. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. \n\nSo, three-digit numbers contribute 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 79 eights. \n\nAdding up all the eights: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (79) = 1 + 19 + 79 = 99 eights. \n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. \n\nSingle-digit: 8 \u2192 1 eight. \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. Units place: 18,28,...,98 \u2192 9 eights. So, 10 + 9 = 19 eights. \n\nThree-digit: tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Units place: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 eights. So, 40 + 39 = 79 eights. \n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 79 = 99 eights. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me think again. \n\nFor units digit 8 in three-digit numbers: \n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 tens digits (0-9), so 10 each, totaling 30. \n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9, each with units digit 8. So, 9. \nTotal: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nYes, that's correct. So, 39 units place eights. \n\nTens place: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. \n\nSo, 40 + 39 = 79 eights in three-digit numbers. \n\nSo, total eights: 1 + 19 + 79 = 99. \n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 has two 8's, but in the tens and units places. So, in the tens place, 488 is counted as part of the tens digit 8 in hundreds digit 4, so that's included in the 40 eights in the tens place. Similarly, the units digit 8 in 488 is included in the 39 units place eights. So, that's correct. \n\nNow, let's compare the number of 4's and 8's. \n\nNumber of 4's: 188. \n\nNumber of 8's: 99. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 99 = 89. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. \n\nWait, I think I might have overcounted the fours in the three-digit numbers. Let me go through the three-digit fours again. \n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. \n\nTens place: For each hundreds digit 1,2,3,4, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. \n\nUnits place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 tens digits, so 10 each, totaling 30. For hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9, each with units digit 4. So, 9. Total units place fours: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours. \n\nFor eights: \n\nSingle-digit: 1. \n\nTwo-digit: 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nThree-digit: tens place 40, units place 39. Total: 79. \n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 79 = 99. \n\nSo, 188 fours - 99 eights = 89. \n\nWait, that seems correct. \n\nBut let me think again: 4's appear more often because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 4's have an advantage in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. \n\nFor units digit 4 in three-digit numbers: \n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 tens digits, so 10 each, totaling 30. \n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9, each with units digit 4. So, 9. \nTotal: 39. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8: \n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30. \n- Hundreds digit 4: 9. \nTotal: 39. \n\nSo, units place for both 4 and 8 have the same count, 39 each. \n\nTens place: 40 for both 4 and 8. \n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8. \n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 40 + 39 = 79. \n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I had earlier. \n\nWait, earlier I thought total eights were 99, but according to this, it's 79. \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier when adding. \n\nLet me recalculate the eights. \n\nSingle-digit: 1. \n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nThree-digit: tens place 40, units place 39. \n\nSo, total eights: 1 + 19 + 40 + 39 = 99. \n\nWait, but in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's, so it's 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 79. \n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nSo, total eights: 20 + 79 = 99. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in three-digit numbers, the eights are 79, but when I added single and two-digit, I got 1 + 19 = 20, then 20 + 79 = 99. \n\nSo, the total eights are 99, and total fours are 188. \n\nSo, 188 - 99 = 89. \n\nSo, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. \n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 99. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me count each separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to be careful not to double-count. Let me count each occurrence. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's exactly one number ending with 4. There are 9 tens (10-99), so that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, 44 is in the 40-49 range, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, the units place in 40-49 would include 44, which we've already counted once. Hmm, but actually, when I count the units place, I should consider all two-digit numbers, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so that's 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). Each of these contributes one 4 in the units place. But 44 has two 4's, so in the units place count, it's one occurrence, but in the tens place, it's another. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 4. Wait, but 44 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the units. So, that's correct because 44 has two 4's. So, total 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, let me check that. From 10-99: tens place 4's: 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 4's. Units place 4's: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 4's. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex. Let's break it down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. Let's consider each case. \n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 1 (100-199): The hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's there. So, no contribution to the count of 4's. \n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 2 (200-299): Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, no 4's. \n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 3 (300-399): Hundreds digit is 3, no 4's. \n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 4 (400-488): Now, the hundreds digit is 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. \n\nNow, let's move to the tens place in three-digit numbers (100-488). The tens digit can be 0-9, but let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488. \n\nWe can break this down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9. For each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? For each hundreds group (100-199), the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times (units 0-9). So, for tens digit 4, that's 10 numbers: 140-149. So, 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, the tens digit 4 appears in 240-249, which is another 10 numbers. So, 10 more 4's in the tens place. \n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 4 appears in 340-349, another 10 numbers. So, 10 more 4's. \n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digit 4, we have 440-449. But wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 more 4's in the tens place. \n\nSo, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nWait, but let me check the last one. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can go up to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 10 occurrences. So, total 40 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, let's check the units place in three-digit numbers (100-488). The units digit cycles 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers up to 488? \n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once. So, for each tens group, 10 numbers, units digit 4 appears once per group. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, for each tens group, units digit 4 appears once, so 10 occurrences. \n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same as above, 10 occurrences. \n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, the tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 4 appears once. That's 9 tens digits (0-8), each contributing one occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes up to 8, not 9. So, for tens digit 8, units digit 4 is still present as 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 9 occurrences in the units place for hundreds digit 4. \n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 4 appears once. That's 9 times. So, 9 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 4. So, yes, 39 total. \n\nNow, let me sum up all the 4's across all page numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. So, total 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 4's.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): the digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99). Let's count 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: numbers 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place count, it's one occurrence, but in the tens place, it's another. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 10-99, the tens digit 8 is in 80-89, 10 numbers. The units digit 8 is in 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers. So, 10 + 9 = 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). Again, let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. \n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): hundreds digit is 1, no 8's.\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): hundreds digit is 2, no 8's.\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): hundreds digit is 3, no 8's.\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 0 8's in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nBreaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit 8 appears in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Tens digit 8 appears in 280-289, another 10 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 8 appears in 380-389, another 10 occurrences.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 8 appears once. So, 10 occurrences (108,118,...,198).\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 10 occurrences (208,218,...,298).\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 10 occurrences (308,318,...,398).\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit 8 can appear in numbers where the tens digit is 0-8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 8 appears once. That's 9 tens digits, so 9 occurrences (408,418,...,488).\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can go up to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, units digit 8 appears once, so 9 times. So, 39 total units place 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78\nSo, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. So, total 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: tens 10 (40-49) + units 9 (14,24,...,94) = 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit: hundreds 89 (400-488), tens 40 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), units 39 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488). So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 (correct)\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: tens 10 (80-89) + units 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit: tens 39 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488) + units 39 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488) = 78. So, 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 (correct)\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers for 4's. When I counted the hundreds place, I said 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers, I had 10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-488, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 occurrences. So, 40 total.\n\nFor the units place in three-digit numbers, I had 10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488. That adds up to 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168, plus single and two-digit, total 188.\n\nFor 8's, the three-digit tens place was 39, units place 39, so 78, plus single and two-digit, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count how many times 4 appears in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete set, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49. Each of these ten numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, there's one block (40-49). In 101-200, another block (140-149). Similarly, 240-249 in 201-300, and 340-349 in 301-400. Then, in 401-488, we have 440-449 as another block. Let me count these blocks. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then from 401-488, another block 440-449. So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. \n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 48 complete sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 1-100: 80-89 (1 block), 101-200: 180-189 (another block), 201-300: 280-289 (another block), 301-400: 380-389 (another block), and 401-488: 480-489. Wait, but 489 is beyond 488, so the block is only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 instead of 10. Let me count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers (1 block)\n- 180-189: 10 (another block)\n- 280-289: 10 (another block)\n- 380-389: 10 (another block)\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 times\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Then, the tens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, 188 - 98 equals 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nStarting with the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nNow, for the units place: In two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit range (10-99), so that's 9 times. \n\nWait, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 9 times. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Pages 100-199. In this case, the hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't contribute to 4's. \n- For hundreds digit 2: Pages 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here. \n- For hundreds digit 3: Pages 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's. \n- For hundreds digit 4: Pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's see how many pages that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to consider each hundred separately (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) and count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149). There are 10 such pages, so 10 times. \n- Similarly, for 200-299: Tens digit 4 appears in 240-249, which is another 10 pages. \n- For 300-399: Tens digit 4 appears in 340-349, another 10 pages. \n- For 400-488: Now, the tens digit cycles, but we need to be careful because the last hundred doesn't go up to 499. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. That's 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 pages. \n\nSo, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Since we have four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, so does that affect the tens digit? No, because the tens digit cycles every 10 pages regardless of how many hundreds. So, 440-449 is still 10 pages, even though the total pages in that hundred are less. So, yes, 10 times. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 for 10 pages. \n\n- For 100-199: Units digit 4 appears in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times. \n- For 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times. \n- For 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times. \n- For 400-488: Now, units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let me count: starting at 404, each 10 pages. 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 to 484 is 9 steps of 10, but let me check: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Yes, that's 9 numbers. Because 484 + 10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, for units digit 4 in three-digit numbers: 10 (for 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times. \n\nWait, but earlier, for the tens place, I had 40 times, and for the hundreds place, 89 times. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 89, tens: 40, units: 39. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. That seems correct. \n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach. \n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. \n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. \n\nUnits place: In each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit is 8 once. There are 9 sets (10-99), so 9 times. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. \n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in any three-digit page number here. \n\nTens place: Let's check each hundred. \n\n- 100-199: Tens digit 8 is in 180-189. That's 10 pages. \n- 200-299: Tens digit 8 is in 280-289. 10 pages. \n- 300-399: Tens digit 8 is in 380-389. 10 pages. \n- 400-488: Tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). \n\nSo, tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nUnits place: In each hundred, the units digit is 8 once every 10 pages. \n\n- 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 times. \n- 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 times. \n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 times. \n- 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included. \n\nSo, units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nWait, but in 400-488, units digit 8 appears 9 times, same as tens place. \n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers: tens (39) + units (39) = 78 times. \n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. \n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst, 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. 1+19=20, 20+168=188. \n\n8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. \n\n188 - 98 = 90. \n\nHmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers for 4's. Let me check again. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. \n\nTens place: Each hundred from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488 has 10, 10, 10, and 10 times respectively? Wait, no, earlier I thought that in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. \n\nUnits place: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct. \n\nFor 8's: \n\nTens place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39. \n\nUnits place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39. \n\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39+39=78. \n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1+19=20, so total 8's: 98. \n\nSo, 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a chance I overcounted somewhere? \n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for units digit 4 in 400-488, I counted 9 times, which is correct because 404, 414, ..., 484 is 9 numbers. Similarly, for units digit 8 in 400-488, it's 408, 418, ..., 488, which is also 9 numbers. \n\nSo, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think of a smaller example to test my method. \n\nSuppose I have a book with pages 1-20. Let's count 4's and 8's. \n\nPage numbers: 1-20. \n\n4's: 4,14,40 (but 40 is beyond 20, so only 4 and 14. Wait, 4 appears in 4 (units), 14 (units), and 40 is beyond. So, two 4's. \n\n8's: 8,18. So, two 8's. \n\nDifference: 2-2=0. \n\nWait, but according to my method: \n\nSingle-digit: 4 once, 8 once. \n\nTwo-digit: \n\nFor 4's: tens place 40-49, but in 1-20, only 40-49 is beyond, so no tens place 4's. Units place: 4 and 14, so two times. \n\nFor 8's: tens place 80-89, beyond, so none. Units place: 8 and 18, two times. \n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 2 (two-digit) = 3? Wait, no, in single-digit, 4 is once, and in two-digit, units place is two times (4 and 14). So, total 4's: 3? But in reality, it's 4,14, which is two times. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. \n\nWait, in single-digit, 4 is once. In two-digit, units digit 4 appears in 4 and 14, which are two times, but 4 is a single-digit number, so perhaps I'm double-counting. Wait, no, because in two-digit numbers, I'm considering 10-99, so 4 is not included in two-digit. So, in 1-9, 4 is once, and in 10-20, units digit 4 is once (14). So, total 4's: 2. \n\nSimilarly, 8's: single-digit once (8), and in two-digit, units digit once (18). So, total 2. \n\nSo, difference is 0. \n\nBut according to my method earlier, for 1-20: \n\nSingle-digit 4's:1, two-digit 4's:1 (14), three-digit:0. Total 2. \n\nSingle-digit 8's:1, two-digit 8's:1 (18), three-digit:0. Total 2. \n\nSo, difference 0. Correct. \n\nBut in my initial method, when I was counting for 1-20, I had to be careful not to include single-digit in two-digit counts. \n\nSo, perhaps my method is correct. \n\nAnother test: pages 1-100. \n\n4's: \n\nSingle-digit:1 (4). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10, units place 4,14,24,...,94:10. So, total two-digit 4's:20. \n\nThree-digit: none, since 100 is the start. \n\nTotal 4's:1+20=21. \n\n8's: \n\nSingle-digit:1 (8). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89:10, units place 8,18,28,...,98:10. So, total two-digit 8's:20. \n\nThree-digit: none. \n\nTotal 8's:1+20=21. \n\nDifference:0. \n\nBut according to my method: \n\n4's: single 1, two-digit 19 (wait, earlier I thought two-digit 4's were 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19, but in reality, from 10-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (4,14,...,94). Wait, no, 4,14,24,...,94 is 10 numbers. So, units digit 4 appears 9 times? Wait, no, from 10-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times? No, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so units digit cycles 9 times (each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in units place). Wait, no, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. So, units digit 4 appears 9 times. Similarly, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, total two-digit 4's:10+9=19. \n\nBut in reality, from 10-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94). Wait, that's 9 numbers, because 14 is the first, then 24, ..., 94. So, 9 times. So, 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. \n\nSimilarly, 8's: tens digit 80-89:10, units digit 8,18,...,98:9 times (since 8 is single-digit, and in two-digit, 18,28,...,98:9 numbers). So, 10+9=19. \n\nSo, total 4's: single 1 + two-digit 19 =20. \n\nTotal 8's: single 1 + two-digit 19=20. \n\nDifference:0. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought of 1-20, I had 4's:2 and 8's:2. \n\nSo, in 1-100, 4's:20, 8's:20. \n\nBut according to my earlier method, in 1-100, 4's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit)=20. 8's:1+19=20. \n\nSo, correct. \n\nBut in the original problem, 488 pages. \n\nSo, going back, I think my counts are correct. \n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, 8's is 98, difference is 90. \n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers for 4's. \n\nIn hundreds place: 400-488:89 pages, so 89 4's. \n\nTens place: in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40. \n\nUnits place: in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399:10 each, so 3*10=30. In 400-488:9 times. So, total units digit 4's:30+9=39. \n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's: \n\nTens place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399:10 each, so 3*10=30. 400-488:9. Total tens digit 8's:39. \n\nUnits place: same, 3*10=30 +9=39. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit:39+39=78. \n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20. So, total 8's:98. \n\nSo, 188-98=90. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n     - Units place: 4,14,24,...,94 \u2192 9 times (since 4 is already counted in single-digit).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n     - Tens place: 10 times in each of the four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n     - Units place: 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** The digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n     - Units place: 8,18,28,...,98 \u2192 9 times (since 8 is already counted in single-digit).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 8 does not appear in any hundreds place (1,2,3,4).\n     - Tens place: 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n     - Units place: 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears exactly once here, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4, which would make the numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place, the units digit can be 4. The tens digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, so that's 9 possibilities (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, but 44 has both tens and units digits as 4, so I might be double-counting that. But since I'm just counting the number of 4's, each occurrence is counted separately, so it's okay. So, that's 9 4's in the units place. \n\nAdding those together, in two-digit numbers, there are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to consider each place separately. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited. Let me handle the hundreds place first. \n\nFor hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, for each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit can be 4. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these can have the tens digit as 4, and the units digit can be anything from 0 to 9. So, that's 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 units digits = 30 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit is 4, but the units digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, units digits can be 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. So, 9 numbers. \n\nWait, but wait: When the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440 to 448, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0 to 9, but since the book only goes up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8. But in this case, for the tens digit being 4, it's okay because 440 to 449 would all be valid, except that the book only goes up to 488. Wait, 449 is less than 488, so actually, the units digits can go from 0 to 9, so that's 10 numbers. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. \n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have the tens digit as 4, and units digits from 0 to 9, so that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 4, units digits from 0 to 9, but since 488 is the last page, 449 is allowed because 449 < 488. So, that's 10 numbers. \n\nWait, but wait: 449 is indeed less than 488, so it's included. So, 10 numbers. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit can be 4, regardless of the hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), and each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 4. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 possible tens digits (0-9), and for each, the units digit can be 4. So, that's 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 tens digits \u00d7 1 (units digit 4) = 30. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Tens digits can be 0-8 because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8. Wait, no, actually, the units digit is 4, so regardless of the tens digit, as long as the hundreds digit is 4, the units digit can be 4. Wait, but if the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, but 4 is less than 8, so it's okay. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits can be 0-8 because the maximum number is 488. Wait, no, actually, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digits can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the maximum. Wait, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8. So, for units digit 4, when the tens digit is 8, it's allowed because 4 is less than 8. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits can be 0-8, which is 9 possibilities, each allowing the units digit to be 4. So, that's 9 numbers. \n\nWait, but wait: Let me think again. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8 because the maximum page is 488. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit can be 4, which is allowed. So, that's 9 tens digits \u00d7 1 (units digit 4) = 9. \n\nWait, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, but 4 is allowed, so yes, it's included. So, total units digits with 4 for hundreds digit 4 is 9. \n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 30 (for hundreds digits 1-3) + 9 (for hundreds digit 4) = 39. \n\nWait, but wait: Let me check that again. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 tens digits, so 10 \u00d7 1 = 10 per hundreds digit, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Tens digits can be 0-8, which is 9, so 9 \u00d7 1 = 9. \n\nSo, total units digits with 4: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of 4's is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, but wait: Let me add them again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach. \n\nStarting with single-digit numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's one 8. \n\nNext, two-digit numbers: 10-99. Again, I'll count the 8's in the tens place and the units place. \n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8, so numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8. The tens digit can be 1-9, so that's 9 possibilities: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Wait, but 88 has both digits as 8, but we're counting each occurrence separately, so that's fine. So, 9 8's in the units place. \n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488. Again, hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8. Let's see how many times this happens. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have the tens digit as 8, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, that's 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 units digits = 30 numbers where the tens digit is 8. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit is 8, but the units digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, units digits can be 0-8, which is 9 possibilities. So, 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8. Let's count how many times this occurs. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have any tens digit (0-9), and the units digit is 8. So, that's 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 tens digits \u00d7 1 (units digit 8) = 30. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since the maximum is 488), and the units digit is 8. So, for each tens digit from 0-8, the units digit is 8. That's 9 possibilities. \n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 30 (for hundreds digits 1-3) + 9 (for hundreds digit 4) = 39. \n\nWait, but wait: Let me double-check. For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 tens digits, so 10 \u00d7 1 = 10 per hundreds digit, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Tens digits can be 0-8, which is 9, so 9 \u00d7 1 = 9. \n\nSo, total units digits with 8: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of 8's is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78. \n\nWait, but wait: Let me add them again. 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. \n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. \n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought maybe the 8's would be more, but according to this, 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's. But let me check my calculations again to be sure. \n\nFirst, checking the 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188. \n\nFor 8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit numbers for 4's and 8's. \n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168. \n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39, units place 39. 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but wait: Let me think about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: none, since the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit can't be 8. \n\nFor two-digit numbers, 4's: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nSimilarly, 8's: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98). 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nSingle-digit: 4 once, 8 once. \n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of 8's in three-digit numbers, I considered the tens place as 39 and units place as 39, totaling 78. Let me confirm that. \n\nFor 8's in three-digit tens place: hundreds digits 1,2,3 each have 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 3\u00d710=30. Hundreds digit 4: tens digit 8, units digits 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nFor 8's in three-digit units place: hundreds digits 1,2,3 each have 10 numbers where units digit is 8, so 3\u00d710=30. Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9 numbers where units digit is 8. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n     - Units place: 9 occurrences (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: \n       - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: 10 each, totaling 30.\n       - For hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 4, units digits 0-9 (10 numbers).\n       - Total: 30 + 10 = 40.\n     - Units place:\n       - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: 10 each, totaling 30.\n       - For hundreds digit 4: Units digit 4, tens digits 0-8 (9 numbers).\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n     - Units place: 9 occurrences (18, 28, ..., 98).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences (since pages go up to 488).\n     - Tens place:\n       - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: 10 each, totaling 30.\n       - For hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 8, units digits 0-8 (9 numbers).\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Units place:\n       - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: 10 each, totaling 30.\n       - For hundreds digit 4: Units digit 8, tens digits 0-8 (9 numbers).\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks. Each block gives 10 4's, so 5 blocks give 5*10=50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's indeed five blocks, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every block of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of ten are there? 48 complete blocks (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and one partial block (480-488) contributing 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488), right? So that's 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488: the hundreds digit is 4, not 8, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49, tens place 8's were 49, so total 98. Now, let me check: units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 8's. Now, comparing 4's and 8's: 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 is correct. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, and then 488 has an 8, so 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So that's 4 full blocks and one partial, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, and so on up to 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So that's correct, 9 numbers. So 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9), so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So that's correct. So 8's in the tens place: 49. Units place: 49. So total 98.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. In the hundreds place for 8's, since the book goes up to 488, there's no page with 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: Let me think about how many times each digit appears in each place. For units digit: from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? For digits 0-9, each digit appears approximately 48 times in the units place (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the last few digits will have an extra count. For digits 1-8, each appears 49 times in the units place, and 9 appears 48 times because 488 ends with 8, so 9 doesn't get that extra count. Wait, but 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once more, so 49 times. Similarly, 4 would appear 49 times in the units place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place, except for the last partial block. Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So 4 hundreds (1-400), but wait, 488 is less than 500, so actually, it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times per digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? From 401-488, that's 88 numbers. So for each tens digit, it appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times (481-488). So for digits 0-7, they appear 10 times each in the tens place in the last partial hundred, and digit 8 appears 9 times. So total for each digit:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50 times.\n- For digit 8: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n- For digit 9: Only in the full hundreds, so 4*10 = 40 times, because in the partial hundred, 490-499 isn't included since the book stops at 488.\n\nWait, but in our case, we're only looking at 8's and 4's. So for 8's in the tens place: 49 times. For 4's in the tens place: 50 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in the tens place were 50, which matches this. So 4's in the tens place: 50, 8's in the tens place: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place: For 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For 8's, there are none because the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, units place for 4's is 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0, totaling 98. So difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. For units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages (since 480/10=48). Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1-8 each get one more count, and 9 doesn't. So for digits 1-8, units place count is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 9, it's 48. So yes, 4's in units place: 49, 8's in units place: 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 49 and 8's in units place were 49, so that's correct. So the total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of 4's in the hundreds place is to realize that it's the number of pages from 400 to 488 inclusive. So 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4's appear in the tens place for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50. So that's correct.\n\nFor the units place, 4's appear once every 10 numbers, so 48 times in the first 480 pages, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n\nSo, adding them up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's.\n\nFor 8's, the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. Units place: 49, as before. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to calculate this. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try that.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 appears and the number of times 8 appears.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n  - high = N // 10\n  - low = N % 10\n  - if d == 0, count = high - 1\n  - else, count = high\n  - if d <= low, count += 1\n  - So for d=4, N=488:\n    high = 488 // 10 = 48\n    low = 488 % 10 = 8\n    since 4 != 0, count = 48\n    since 4 <= 8, count +=1 \u2192 49\n  - Similarly for d=8:\n    high = 48\n    low =8\n    count =48\n    since 8 <=8, count +=1 \u219249\n\nSo units place: 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For tens digit, the formula is a bit different.\n  - The number of times d appears in the tens place is:\n    - high = N // 100\n    - current = (N // 10) % 10\n    - low = N % 10\n    - if d == 0:\n        count = high * 10\n        if current > 0:\n            count += 10\n        else:\n            count += low\n    - else:\n        count = high * 10\n        if current > d:\n            count +=10\n        elif current == d:\n            count += low +1\n        else:\n            count +=0\n  - Let me apply this for d=4:\n    high = 488 // 100 =4\n    current = (488 //10) %10 =48 %10=8\n    low=8\n    since d=4 !=0:\n        count=4*10=40\n        since current=8 >4:\n            count +=10 \u219250\n  - So 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n  - For d=8:\n    high=4\n    current=8\n    low=8\n    since d=8 !=0:\n        count=4*10=40\n        since current=8 ==d=8:\n            count += low +1=8+1=9 \u219240+9=49\n  - So 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For hundreds digit, the formula is:\n  - high = N // 1000\n  - current = (N // 100) %10\n  - low = N % 100\n  - if d==0:\n      count=high*100\n      if current>0:\n          count +=100\n      else:\n          count += low\n  - else:\n      count=high*100\n      if current >d:\n          count +=100\n      elif current ==d:\n          count += low +1\n      else:\n          count +=0\n  - For d=4:\n    high=488//1000=0\n    current=(488//100)%10=4\n    low=488%100=88\n    since d=4 !=0:\n        count=0*100=0\n        since current=4 ==d=4:\n            count += low +1=88+1=89\n  - So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n  - For d=8:\n    high=0\n    current=4\n    low=88\n    since d=8 !=0:\n        count=0\n        since current=4 <8:\n            count +=0\n  - So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo yes, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
