    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. But wait, when considering the entire range up to 488, I need to see how many complete sets of 10 there are and if there's a partial set at the end. \n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). In each complete set of 10, the units digit 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each. Now, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 +1 =49, and 8's:48 +1=49. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check. From 1 to 488, the number of complete sets of 10 is 48, and the partial set is 8 numbers. So, for each digit in the units place, in the complete sets, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 48 times. But wait, actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so for each digit, the count is the number of complete sets times 1, plus any occurrences in the partial set. So, for 4 in units place: 48 sets *1 +1 (from 484) =49. Similarly, 8 in units place: 48*1 +1=49. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the entire range up to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, the number of complete hundreds is 4, and then a partial hundred of 88 pages. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each. Now, in the partial hundred (301-488), but wait, actually, the hundreds place is 1-4, so the partial hundred is 401-488, right? Wait, no, the partial hundred after 400 is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. \n\nWait, but let me check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? For tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, for 0-7, each appears 10 times, except for 8 which appears 9 times). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times it appears is 10 times per hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the last tens digit (8) only appears 9 times (480-488). So, for the tens place in 401-488, 4 appears once as the tens digit (440-449), which is 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, in the tens place for the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, for the entire 1-488, the digit 4 appears 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) +10 (from the partial hundred) =50 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 4*10 +9=49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nWait, let me confirm. For the complete hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), so total 40+10=50. For 8's in the tens place, in the complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times, so total 40+9=49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, for page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's =49 +49 +0 =98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, plus the partial set of 8 pages, where both 4 and 8 appear once. So, 48+1=49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. The difference is 188-98=90. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to break it down by the number of digits. So, for single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears only once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. Let's consider the tens place first. The tens digit can be 1 to 9, and the ones digit can be 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the page numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences. Now, for the ones place in two-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear? For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. Since there are 9 sets (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but from 10-99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, 9 times 4 appears in the ones place. So, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 times. So, total so far for 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) = 20. Now, let's move on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and ones places. Let's handle each place separately. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, for the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit can be 1-4, but we're looking for when the tens digit is 4. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range x40-x49, where x is the hundreds digit. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 3 * 10 = 30. For hundreds digit 4: the tens digit is 4, so the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40. Now, the ones place in three-digit numbers. The ones digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. For each hundreds group, each set of ten numbers (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.) has one 4 in the ones place. So, for each hundreds group, there are 10 numbers where the ones digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, etc.). There are 4 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). For the first three groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 numbers with ones digit 4, so that's 3 * 10 = 30. For the 400-488 group, how many numbers have ones digit 4? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, because from 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, ..., up to 484. Let me count: starting at 404, each 10 numbers adds one, so how many? From 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 times. So, the ones place in the hundreds group 400-488 contributes 9 occurrences. So, total ones place occurrences: 30 (from first three groups) + 9 = 39. So, in three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168 times. So, total 4's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process. Single-digit page numbers: 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence. Two-digit page numbers: tens and ones places. Tens place: when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences. Ones place: for each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the ones digit is 8 once. There are 9 sets (10-99), so 9 occurrences. So, two-digit numbers contribute 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 8. Now, three-digit numbers: hundreds, tens, and ones places. Hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8? Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences there. Tens place: for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range x80-x89. For each of the first three groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 10 numbers each, so 3 * 10 = 30. For the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences. So, total in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39. Ones place: for each hundreds group, each set of ten has one number with ones digit 8. For the first three groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 10 numbers each, so 3 * 10 = 30. For the 400-488 group, how many numbers have ones digit 8? They are 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: from 408 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, total ones place occurrences: 30 + 9 = 39. So, in three-digit numbers, 8's appear 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78 times. So, total 8's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n   - Units place: Each ten (e.g., 10-19) has one 4 \u2192 9 sets \u2192 9 times.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   - Tens place: For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), 10 times each \u2192 3 groups \u00d7 10 + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n   - Units place: Each hundred group has 10 times, but 400-488 has 9 \u2192 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n   - Units place: Each ten (e.g., 10-19) has one 8 \u2192 9 sets \u2192 9 times.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 8 doesn't appear.\n   - Tens place: Each hundred group has 10 times, but 400-488 has 9 \u2192 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39.\n   - Units place: Each hundred group has 10 times, but 400-488 has 9 \u2192 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can break this down by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the single-digit numbers, the 4 appears once (page 4). In the two-digit numbers, the 4 appears once every ten pages, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten, so 9 times. But wait, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 10-19, 4 appears once (14), 20-29, once (24), and so on up to 90-99. So that's 9 times. But wait, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10, so 9 times 4 in the units place. So that's 9. Then, for the three-digit numbers, from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there are 10 numbers ending with 4. But wait, from 100-199, the units digit cycles every 10, so 104, 114, ..., 194. That's 10 times. Similarly, from 200-299, 204, 214, ..., 294, another 10 times. From 300-399, same thing: 304, 314, ..., 394, another 10 times. Now, from 400-488, the units digit goes up to 488, so the last set would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So from 100-488, the units digit 4 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. But wait, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's three hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30, and then 400-488 contributing 9, so total units digit 4's: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For single-digit numbers, there's no tens digit, so 4 doesn't appear there. In the two-digit numbers, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. So that's 10 times. For the three-digit numbers, the tens digit is 4. Let's see: from 100-488, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is included. So that's 40 times. So total tens digit 4's: 10 (from two-digit) + 40 (from three-digit) = 50 times. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. For single-digit and two-digit numbers, there's no hundreds digit. In the three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So that's 89 times. \n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 39 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 39+50=89, plus 89 is 178. So 4 appears 178 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Single-digit numbers: 8 appears once (page 8). Two-digit numbers: from 10-99, the units digit is 8 once every ten numbers, so 10-19:18, 20-29:28, ..., 90-99:98. That's 9 times. So units digit 8's: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) = 10. Now, for three-digit numbers, 100-488. The units digit is 8 in 108,118,...,198; 208,218,...,298; 308,318,...,398; 408,418,...,488. Wait, from 100-199: 108,118,...,198: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 208,...,298: 10. 300-399: 308,...,398: 10. 400-488: 408,418,...,488. How many are there? Let's see: starting at 408, each 10 numbers, so 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So units digit 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So total units digit 8's: 10 (from single and two-digit) + 39 = 49. Wait, no, actually, I think I might have miscounted. Let me clarify: single-digit: 1, two-digit:9, so units digit 8's up to 99: 10. Then, three-digit: from 100-488, units digit 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39. So total units digit 8's: 10 + 39=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10+39=49, but I'm not sure. Let me check again: single-digit:1, two-digit:9, so up to 99:10. Then, three-digit:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So total units digit 8's:10+10+10+9=39, but wait, that's just the three-digit part. So total units digit 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) = 1+9+39=49. So 49 times in units place.\n\nNow, tens place for 8. Single-digit numbers: no tens digit, so 0. Two-digit numbers: the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 times. Three-digit numbers: tens digit is 8. So in 100-488, the tens digit is 8 in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes up to 8. So how many numbers are there? 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So that's 10+10+10+9=39 times. So total tens digit 8's: two-digit (10) + three-digit (39) =49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8. Single-digit and two-digit numbers: no hundreds digit. Three-digit numbers: hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0=98.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units digit 8's:49, tens digit 8's:49, hundreds digit 8's:0. So total 98.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought units digit 8's were 49, but let me recount. Single-digit:1 (page 8). Two-digit: 18,28,...,98: that's 9 numbers, so 1+9=10 up to 99. Then, three-digit:108,118,...,198:10; 208,...,298:10; 308,...,398:10; 408,...,488:9. So 10+10+10+9=39. So total units digit 8's:10+39=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens digit 8's: two-digit:80-89:10. Three-digit:180-189:10; 280-289:10; 380-389:10; 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+9=39. So total tens digit 8's:10+39=49. That's correct.\n\nSo total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 178, as calculated earlier. So the difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits digit: single-digit:1 (4). Two-digit:14,24,...,94:9. Three-digit:104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9. So units digit 4's:1+9+10+10+10+9=49? Wait, earlier I thought it was 39. Wait, no, I think I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify:\n\nFor units digit 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:14,24,...,94: that's 9 pages (from 10-99).\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:104,114,...,194:10.\n\n200-299:204,...,294:10.\n\n300-399:304,...,394:10.\n\n400-488:404,414,...,484:9.\n\nSo units digit 4's:1+9+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units digit 4's were 39. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo units digit 4's:49.\n\nTens digit 4's:\n\nTwo-digit:40-49:10.\n\nThree-digit:140-149:10; 240-249:10; 340-349:10; 440-449:10.\n\nSo that's 4 sets of 10, so 40.\n\nSo tens digit 4's:10 (two-digit) +40=50.\n\nHundreds digit 4's:\n\n400-488:89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. So I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units digit 4's were 39, but now I'm getting 49. Let me check again.\n\nYes, single-digit:1, two-digit:9, three-digit:10+10+10+9=39. So total units digit 4's:1+9+39=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 4's: two-digit:10, three-digit:10+10+10+10=40, so total 50.\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation of 178. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds digit. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, for 8's, I had 49 units +49 tens=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178, but now I'm getting 188. So I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the initial calculation, I think I missed some counts. Let me go through it again.\n\nUnits digit 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit:14,24,...,94:9.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:104,114,...,194:10.\n\n200-299:204,...,294:10.\n\n300-399:304,...,394:10.\n\n400-488:404,414,...,484:9.\n\nSo units digit 4's:1+9+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nTens digit 4's:\n\nTwo-digit:40-49:10.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n140-149:10.\n\n240-249:10.\n\n340-349:10.\n\n440-449:10.\n\nSo that's 4 sets of 10:40.\n\nTotal tens digit 4's:10+40=50.\n\nHundreds digit 4's:400-488:89.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit:18,28,...,98:9.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n108,118,...,198:10.\n\n208,...,298:10.\n\n308,...,398:10.\n\n408,...,488:9.\n\nSo units digit 8's:1+9+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nTens digit 8's:\n\nTwo-digit:80-89:10.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9.\n\nSo tens digit 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, no, wait: two-digit is 10, three-digit is 10+10+10+9=39, so total tens digit 8's:10+39=49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nSo total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 80, but that was because I had miscalculated the units digit 4's as 39 instead of 49. So the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nHow many such numbers? The last one is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So n= (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:8,18,28,...,488.\n\n488 is included, so how many? 488=8+10*(n-1). n=(488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units digit 8's were 49, which matches this.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nFor 4 in tens place:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges:5*10=50.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, 440-449 is included, so that's 10 numbers. So total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and 480-488 has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49, but according to this, it's 49. So that's correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\n4 appears in 400-488:89 numbers.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds digit because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 80, but that was because I had miscalculated the units digit 4's as 39 instead of 49. So the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more to be sure.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor((488-4)/10) +1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears: floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4: each hundred contributes 10 times, and the last partial hundred (400-488) contributes 10 times (440-449). So total 4*10=40, plus the two-digit numbers 40-49:10. So total 50.\n\nFor 8: each hundred contributes 10 times, except the last partial hundred (400-488) contributes 9 times (480-488). So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. But wait, the two-digit numbers 80-89:10. So total 10+40+9=59? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 8:\n\nFrom 1-99:80-89:10.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo total tens digit 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99:40-49:10.\n\nFrom 100-199:140-149:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10.\n\nSo total tens digit 4's:10+10+10+10+10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488:89 times.\n\n8 never appears.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4, making it 49 in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these blocks has one decade where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours. But wait, in the last block, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for the entire 401-410 range, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So total tens place fours would be 40 (from the first four blocks) plus 10, making 50. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so maybe I should consider that. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. For units digit 4, it occurs once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is the last number with a units digit of 4 in this partial group. So that's one more, making it 49. So units place: 49.\n\nTens place: As before, 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me see: 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. So 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's. For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit being 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, there's one block where the tens digit is 8, so 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, that's 9 more 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, tens place total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but when I counted the units place for 8's, I thought 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in the last partial group (488), so 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: 50.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I count the tens digit as 4, I considered each hundred having one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so 40 numbers in the first four hundreds, and then in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, yes, 10 more.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit of 8, in the last partial hundred, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- For 4: as before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and one more in the last partial ten, so 49.\n\n- For 8: same as 4, 49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\n- For 4: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (401-410), so 10 more, total 50.\n\n- For 8: in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds, 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, total 49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\n- For 4: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- For 8: no hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps using a formula or a different approach.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a formula that considers each digit place separately.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just stick with my initial approach.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try to count the number of 4's and 8's again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10 4's. There are four full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and one more in the last partial ten (484), so 49. Correct.\n\nSame for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours.

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. Similarly, 8 appears once every ten numbers. But wait, I'm focusing on 4's first. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? \n\nWell, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete groups of ten is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, each group of ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of ten, so there's an extra 8 pages (481-488). In these extra pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number where 4 appears in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens every hundred numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488? \n\nLet's see, the first occurrence is from 40-49, which is ten times. Then, the next occurrence would be 140-149, another ten times. Then 240-249, another ten, and 340-349, another ten. Now, 440-449 would be the next, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another ten. Let me count how many hundreds: 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. So, in each hundred, the 4 in the tens place occurs once every hundred, contributing ten numbers. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is ten numbers. So, in each hundred from 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit 4 appears once every hundred, contributing ten 4's. So, for 0-99, 40-49: ten 4's. Similarly, 140-149: ten, 240-249: ten, 340-349: ten, and 440-449: ten. So, that's five sets of ten, each contributing ten 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is in the 400s, which is the fifth hundred. So, total 5 x 10 = 50 times. \n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's. \n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, total number of 4's is units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. \n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488. \n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 48 complete tens (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNow, the tens place for 8: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these ranges contributes ten 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so that's nine numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be ten numbers, but we only have up to 488, so 480-488 is nine numbers. Wait, no: 480 is the start, then 481, 482, ..., up to 488. So, that's nine numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, 480 is included, which is the first number, so 480-488 is nine numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for nine numbers. \n\nWait, but let me think again. From 80-89: ten numbers, so ten 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: ten, 280-289: ten, 380-389: ten, and 480-488: nine. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. From 80-89: ten 8's. 180-189: ten, 280-289: ten, 380-389: ten, and 480-488: nine. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, total number of 8's is units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's. \n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 188 4's. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both digits. \n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every ten numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which has a 4 in the units place, so +1, totaling 49. \n\n- Tens place: 40-49: ten 4's, 140-149: ten, 240-249: ten, 340-349: ten, 440-449: ten. That's five sets, each contributing ten 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. \n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. \n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so +1, totaling 49. \n\n- Tens place: 80-89: ten 8's, 180-189: ten, 280-289: ten, 380-389: ten, 480-488: nine (since 480-488 is nine numbers, but wait, 480-488 is nine numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is nine numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's nine. So, 4 sets of ten (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 x 10 = 40, plus 480-488: nine, so total 40 + 9 = 49. \n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me check again: 188 4's and 98 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to count the 4's and 8's. \n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position. \n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4's: As before, 49 times. \n\n- For 8's: 49 times. \n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: 50 times. \n\n- For 8's: 49 times. \n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: 89 times. \n\n- For 8's: 0 times. \n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. \n\nI think I've covered all the cases. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete sets of ten (1-480) contribute 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89 fours. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete sets of ten contribute 48 eights. The remaining 8 numbers include 488, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 eights, and 480-488 contributes 9. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No eights, as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484 will have a 4 in the units place. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers will have exactly one number ending with 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times, right? Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 49 numbers ending with 4 because 488 is included. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th number because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, only the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. \n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place. Numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Because 488 is included. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 380-389 go up to 488? Yes, 389 is less than 488. So, 40 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, zero times 8 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: from 4 to 484, which is 484 - 4 / 10 +1 = 48.4 +1? Wait, maybe another way. The number of numbers ending with 4 is floor(488/10) +1 if the last number is 488 or higher. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: same logic, 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, 40 numbers. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: none, since 488 is less than 800. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+40=89. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 -89=99. So, 99 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 89 times. Subtracting these gives 99 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, that's 1 more time. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, this repeats every 100 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But since we're considering the tens place, each full ten contributes one digit. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only once for each ten. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Wait, no, I'm looking for 4's in the tens place. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, right? Wait, 440-449 would be within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 440 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449). So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, and 440-449 is within that, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, adding that to the 40 from the first 400 pages, that's 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Each set of ten has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each set, units digit 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, so in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). But wait, each ten contributes one digit in the tens place. So, in 480-489, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but when considering the tens digit, each full ten (e.g., 480-489) would have the tens digit 8 appearing 10 times. But since we're stopping at 488, which is 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears once in each hundred, but in the incomplete hundred, how many times does it appear?\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first 400 pages, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting 4's, I got 188, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But I feel like that might not be correct because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's: from 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I should consider each digit place separately and ensure I'm not missing any edge cases.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: from 1-488, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, so that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40 from the first 400 pages and 10 from 401-488, which adds up to 50. So that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 4's: from 1-488, each 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place, so 48 full tens, 48 times, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers is that? It's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in each of these 9 numbers, so that's 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the tens place for 4's, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my count is accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is incomplete. Wait, no, from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and 1 partial set (9 numbers), so 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as 4 hundreds contributing 10 each, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula.\n\nFor a digit d in a certain position, the number of times it appears can be calculated using the formula:\n\ncount = higher * current * 10^(position-1) + ... etc.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nBut I think my initial approach was thorough and accurate. So, I'm confident that the number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I can list the counts again.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) with 48 4's, plus 1 in 484, total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) with 40 4's, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 numbers (400-488), so 89 4's.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) with 48 8's, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) with 40 8's, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 fours. Additionally, 440-449 in the range 401-488 adds 10 fours. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, each set of 10 contributes one 8. From 1 to 488, 48 sets contribute 48 eights. In the remaining 8 numbers, 488 adds 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). From 1-400, 4 hundreds contribute 40 eights. From 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can break this down by the number of digits. For single-digit page numbers, the only page with a 4 is page 4. So that's one 4. For two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. In the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. In the units place, the numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, that's 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count it twice? Hmm, no, because I'm counting each occurrence of the digit. So, 44 has two 4's, so that would add two 4's. But actually, when I list them out, from 14 to 94, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But 44 is included, which has a 4 in both tens and units. So, when I counted the tens place, I already counted the 4 in 44's tens digit. So, in the units place, 44's units digit is another 4, so I should count that separately. So, in the units place, from 14 to 94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, so that's 9 4's. Plus the 10 from the tens place, that's 19 4's in two-digit numbers. Wait, but 44 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the units. But that's correct because it has two 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Now, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be more than 4. Let's consider each hundreds digit separately.\n\n1. Hundreds digit is 1: Pages 100-199. How many 4's are there in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, 0 4's here.\n\n2. Hundreds digit is 2: Pages 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here. 0 4's.\n\n3. Hundreds digit is 3: Pages 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's here. 0 4's.\n\n4. Hundreds digit is 4: Pages 400-488. Now, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's count 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit can be 1-4, but we're looking for when the tens digit is 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Pages 100-199. Tens digit is 4: 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Pages 200-299. Tens digit 4: 240-249. Another 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: Pages 300-399. Tens digit 4: 340-349. Another 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Pages 400-488. Tens digit 4: 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 4's here.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9, so for each hundreds and tens combination, there's one 4 in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Pages 100-199. For each tens digit (0-9), there's one 4 in the units place. So, 10 tens digits, each contributing one 4, so 10 4's.\n\n- Similarly, hundreds digit 2: 200-299. 10 4's in the units place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's one 4 in the units place. That's 9 tens digits, each contributing one 4, so 9 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so when tens digit is 8, units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit from 0 to 8, and then stops at 8 for tens digit 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 9 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For hundreds=4, tens digits go from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a units digit of 4 once. So, 9 times. So, yes, 9 4's in the units place for hundreds=4.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the two-digit numbers, I had 10 4's in the tens place (40-49) and 9 in the units place (14,24,...,94). But 44 is included in both, so that's correct because it has two 4's. So, 10 + 9 = 19, which is correct.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488), tens place: 40 (10 for each hundreds digit 1,2,3,4), units place: 39 (10 for hundreds 1,2,3 and 9 for hundreds 4). So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: only page 8. So, 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. But 88 has two 8's, so that's an extra 8 in the units place. So, total 9 in units place, but 88 is counted once in tens and once in units. So, total 8's in units place: 9.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\n- Hundreds place: hundreds digit is 8? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundreds digit, when the tens digit is 8.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 180-189. That's 10 8's in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 280-289. Another 10.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389. Another 10.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8, so pages 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, units place for three-digit numbers: For each hundreds and tens combination, there's one 8 in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: For each tens digit (0-9), units digit 8 occurs once. So, 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, units digit 8 occurs once. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds digit 4, tens digits go up to 8, so units digit 8 occurs once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, which is 9 times. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check:\n\nSingle-digit: 8 \u2192 1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89 \u2192 10, units place 18,28,...,98 \u2192 9, total 19.\n\nThree-digit: tens place for hundreds 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30, and hundreds 4: 9, total 39. Units place: hundreds 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30, and hundreds 4: 9, total 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the total 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 4 \u2192 1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u2192 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so that's 9 +1 = 10? Wait, no, because each occurrence is counted. So, in the units place, each of those 9 numbers contributes one 4, except 44, which contributes two. Wait, no, in the units place, 44 is just one occurrence, because when you count units place, you're looking at the last digit. So, 44 has a 4 in the units place, so it's one occurrence. So, units place: 9 4's.\n\nSo, two-digit 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds 1,2,3,4: 10 each, so 40.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30, and hundreds 4: 9, so total 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n- Units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 for each hundreds digit 1,2,3, and 9 for hundreds digit 4. So, 10*3 +9=39.\n\nUnits place: same as tens place, 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 39 + 39 = 167? Wait, no, 89 + 39 is 128, plus 39 is 167? Wait, but earlier I had 168. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. Wait, but in the tens place, I had 10 for each hundreds digit 1,2,3,4, but for hundreds digit 4, it's only 9 because 488 is the last page. So, for tens place:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSimilarly, units place:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 167.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 168. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place. For hundreds digit 1, tens digit 4: 140-149, that's 10 numbers. Similarly for hundreds 2,3,4. Wait, for hundreds 4, tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 10, not 9.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that for hundreds 4, tens digit 4 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's in the tens place for hundreds 4.\n\nWait, but when I was counting 8's, for hundreds 4, tens digit 8 was 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the 4's count.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place:\n\n  - Hundreds 1: 140-149: 10\n  - Hundreds 2: 240-249: 10\n  - Hundreds 3: 340-349: 10\n  - Hundreds 4: 440-449: 10\n  Total: 10+10+10+10=40.\n\n- Units place:\n\n  - Hundreds 1: 104,114,...,194: 10\n  - Hundreds 2: 204,214,...,294: 10\n  - Hundreds 3: 304,314,...,394: 10\n  - Hundreds 4: 404,414,...,484: but since the last page is 488, units digit 4 occurs when the tens digit is 0-8, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nEarlier, I thought that for hundreds 4, tens digit 4 was 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, the tens place for three-digit numbers is 40, not 39. So, the total 4's in three-digit numbers is 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place:\n\n  - Hundreds 1: 180-189:10\n  - Hundreds 2: 280-289:10\n  - Hundreds 3: 380-389:10\n  - Hundreds 4: 480-488:9\n  Total: 39.\n\n- Units place:\n\n  - Hundreds 1: 108,118,...,198:10\n  - Hundreds 2: 208,218,...,298:10\n  - Hundreds 3: 308,318,...,398:10\n  - Hundreds 4: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488:9\n  Total: 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the tens place for hundreds 4 in 8's was 9, but for 4's it was 10. So, that makes sense because 440-449 is within 400-488, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in two-digit numbers, 44 is counted once in tens and once in units, which is correct because it has two 4's. Similarly, in three-digit numbers, 444 would have three 4's, but I'm counting each occurrence, so that's correct.\n\nYes, I think 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences. (Note: 44 is counted once here, as we're counting digit occurrences, not unique numbers.)\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit '4' appears 10 times each except for hundreds=4, which is 10 times (440-449). Total: 10*3 + 10 = 40.\n     - Units place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the units digit '4' appears 10 times except for hundreds=4, which appears 9 times (404,414,...,484). Total: 10*3 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u2192 9 occurrences. (Note: 88 is counted once here.)\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Tens place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit '8' appears 10 times except for hundreds=4, which is 9 times (480-488). Total: 10*3 + 9 = 39.\n     - Units place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the units digit '8' appears 10 times except for hundreds=4, which appears 9 times (408,418,...,488). Total: 10*3 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers of the book.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49 all have 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes ten 4's. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, the first block is 40-49, which is one block. Then, the next possible block would be 140-149, but wait, actually, every hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100, there's 40-49, which is ten 4's. Then, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another ten. Similarly, in 201-300, it's 240-249, and in 301-400, it's 340-349. Now, 400-488 is another case. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, then 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, does 400-488 include a block where the tens digit is 4? Let me see: 440-449 would be the block where the tens digit is 4. So, that's another ten 4's. So, how many blocks do we have? From 1-400, we have four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing ten 4's. Then, in 400-488, we have another block, 440-449, contributing ten more 4's. So, that's 5 blocks, each with ten 4's, totaling 5*10 = 50. Wait, but let me check the last block: 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of ten are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, contributing 48 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes ten 8's. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 1-100: 80-89 (10 8's), 101-200: 180-189 (another 10), 201-300: 280-289 (another 10), 301-400: 380-389 (another 10). Then, in 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 480-489 would be the block where the tens digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 8's instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 from 480-488, so 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (1-480) contribute 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contribute ten fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten contribute 48 eights, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 40 eights, plus nine from 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No contributions.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4); from 11-20, 4 appears once (at 14), and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4. So that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, for the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). Each of the 4 complete sets contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. Let's see, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which has a tens digit of 8. Wait, no, 481-490 would be tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's still 481-488, which is 8 numbers with tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, do we have any 4's in the remaining 88 numbers? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, right? Because 400-499 would have tens digits from 0-9. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the complete sets) + 10 = 50. Now, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place separately. Units place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, there are 48 complete sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 * 1 = 48, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So, 4 complete sets of 100 contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49. Tens place: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the remaining 88 numbers, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so +89. 49 + 50 = 99, +89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 48 sets of 10, +1 in 488, total 49. Tens place: 4 sets of 100, 40, plus in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, which is correct. So, I think the count is accurate. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48 fours, and the last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more (484), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries contribute 40 fours, and the remaining pages (401-488) add 10 fours (440-449), totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48 eights, and the last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more (488), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries contribute 40 eights, and the remaining pages (401-488) add 9 eights (480-488), totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No eights are present.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits. For single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9, the only number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. Now, for two-digit page numbers, from 10 to 99. I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. In the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 4's. In the units place, the numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I don't double count. Hmm, actually, no, because when I count the units place separately, each occurrence is counted individually. So, from 10 to 99, in the units place, there are 9 4's (14,24,...,94), but wait, 44 is included in both the tens and units place. So, when I count the tens place, I get 10 4's, and when I count the units place, I get 9 4's, but 44 is already counted in both. So, the total for two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I have to add an extra? No, because each digit is counted separately. So, in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 4's, and in the units place, 14,24,...,94 gives 9 4's, but 44 is included in both. So, the total is 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. Now, for three-digit page numbers, from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. First, the hundreds place: in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, the only time 4 appears is in 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, the tens place in three-digit numbers: I need to consider each hundred block separately. From 100-199, the tens digit can be 0-9, so the 4's in the tens place would be in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so 10 4's. Similarly, in 200-299, the 4's in the tens place are in 240-249, another 10 4's. Same for 300-399: 340-349, 10 4's. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so the 4's in the tens place would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is part of 400-488, so yes, 10 4's. So, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 4's. Now, the units place in three-digit numbers: again, each hundred block. From 100-199, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. So, 100-199: 10 4's in units place, 200-299: 10 4's, 300-399: 10 4's, and 400-488: let's see, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, 488 is the end, so the last decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each full decade (10 numbers), the units digit 4 appears once. So, from 400-480, that's 8 decades, so 8 times, and then 484 is the next occurrence in 480-488. So, total 9 times. Wait, no, 400-409: 404, 410-419: 414, ..., 480-488: 484. So, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the units place for 400-488. Therefore, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168 4's. Wait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39. So, 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168. Now, let's add up all the 4's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. So, total 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Maybe I should do the same approach. Single-digit page numbers: from 1-9, the number 8 is present once, so that's one 8. Now, two-digit page numbers: from 10-99. Again, tens place and units place. In the tens place, the 8's are in 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. In the units place, the 8's are in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's. So, in the units place, how many 8's? Each occurrence is counted, so 18,28,...,98: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 8's. But wait, 88 is included in both the tens and units place. So, when I count the tens place, I get 10 8's, and in the units place, I get 9 8's, but 88 is counted twice. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, so does that mean I have to subtract one? No, because each digit is counted separately. So, in the tens place, 80-89: 10 8's, in the units place, 18,28,...,98: 9 8's, but 88 is included in both. So, the total is 10 + 9 = 19 8's in two-digit numbers. Now, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. Hundreds place: 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for any three-digit page number, since 488 is the last page, and 4 is the hundreds digit. So, hundreds place: 0 8's. Tens place: For each hundred block, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit 8 appears in a decade, e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc. So, for 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place: 10 8's. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10 8's. 300-399: 380-389, 10 8's. 400-488: the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's. Now, units place in three-digit numbers: again, each hundred block. From 100-199, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. So, 100-199: 10 8's in units place, 200-299: 10 8's, 300-399: 10 8's, and 400-488: let's see, from 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the units place for 400-488. Therefore, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78 8's. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens place in three-digit numbers was 39, and the units place was 39, so total 39 + 39 = 78 8's in three-digit numbers. Now, adding up all the 8's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So, total 8's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. Total:1+19=20+168=188. For 8's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. Total:1+19=20+78=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the three-digit 4's again. Hundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Tens place: in each hundred block (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 10*4=40. Units place: in each hundred block, 10 times, except 400-488, which is 9 times. So, 10+10+10+9=39. So, 89+40+39=168. That's correct. For 8's: hundreds place:0. Tens place:10+10+10+9=39. Units place:10+10+10+9=39. So, 39+39=78. So, 78+19+1=98. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only one 4 appears (page 4).\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: Pages 40-49 contribute 10 4's.\n   - Units place: Pages 14, 24, ..., 94 contribute 9 4's.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 4's.\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - Tens place: Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10 4's, totaling 40.\n   - Units place: Each hundred block contributes 10 4's, except 400-488, which contributes 9, totaling 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's.\n4. **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only one 8 appears (page 8).\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: Pages 80-89 contribute 10 8's.\n   - Units place: Pages 18, 28, ..., 98 contribute 9 8's.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 8's.\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: No 8's appear.\n   - Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 8's, except 400-488, which contributes 9, totaling 39.\n   - Units place: Each hundred block contributes 10 8's, except 400-488, which contributes 9, totaling 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78 8's.\n4. **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits. For single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once, right? So that's 1 occurrence. Now, for two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. In the tens place, the numbers 40-49 have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. In the units place, the numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 have a 4 in the units digit. Wait, but 44 has both a 4 in the tens and units place, so I have to make sure I'm not double-counting. But actually, when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's. So, from 10-99, the units place contributes 9 times (14,24,...,94) and the tens place contributes 10 times (40-49). So total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences. Wait, but 44 is included in both, so does that mean I'm counting it twice? Let me check: 44 has two 4's, so when I count the tens place, I include one 4, and when I count the units place, I include another 4. So, in total, 44 contributes two 4's, which is correct. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 is correct. Now, for three-digit page numbers, from 100 to 488. Let me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. First, the hundreds place: numbers from 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, the tens place for three-digit numbers: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit. So, for each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). There are four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, so I need to adjust that. Let me see: For hundreds 100-399, each has a full set of tens digits, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, the units place for three-digit numbers: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 occurrences. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. Now, for 400-488, the units digit is 4 in numbers like 404, 414, ..., 484. How many are there? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10, so that's 9 numbers (since 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484). Wait, let me count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total for units place in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39. Now, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (hundreds 89 + tens 40 + units 39). Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me clarify. Wait, no, actually, for three-digit numbers, the hundreds place contributes 89, tens place 40, and units place 39. So, total for three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, adding single-digit (1) and two-digit (19): 1 + 19 = 20. So total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188. Now, let me check that again. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when I broke down the three-digit numbers, I considered hundreds, tens, and units separately. So, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. Then, single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) = 20. So, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider each digit place separately across all page numbers. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. So, 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same logic. From 1 to 480, 48 occurrences, and from 481-488, 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 is page 488, which is the last page. So, in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 is included, so yes, 488 is page 488, so units digit 8 appears once in 481-488. So, total 49.\n\nWait, but for 4's in units place, from 1-480, 48 times, and 484 is within 481-488, so units digit 4 appears once more. So, total 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. From 1-480, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, 480/10=48, so 48 times 4 in units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, from 1-480: 48 times, and from 481-488, 8 appears once (488). So, total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but now I'm getting 49. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, units place:\n\n4's: 49\n\n8's: 49\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit as 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nSo, for 1-99: tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n\nFor 100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10.\n\n300-399: 340-349, 10.\n\nNow, 400-488: the tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89 is where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, 1-99: 80-89, 10 times.\n\n100-199: 180-189, 10.\n\n200-299: 280-289, 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389, 10.\n\n400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:49\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nBut let me check again, because I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again to confirm.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, and then in 481-488, 484 is included, so 49 times.\n\n- 8's: similarly, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, and 488 is included, so 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, and there are 5 hundreds (1-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so that's the fifth hundred. So, 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, and 10 in the 400-488 (since 440-449 is 10 numbers). So, 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- 8's: in each of the first four hundreds, 10 times, and in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- 8's: no hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 188-98=90, so 90 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 400-488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the total is correct: 188 4's and 98 8's, so 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place. \n     - Total units place '4's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In each hundred (e.g., 1-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49).\n     - There are five sets (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - Total tens place '4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total hundreds place '4's: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to '4's, '8's appear once every 10 numbers.\n     - Total units place '8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In each hundred, the tens digit '8' appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89).\n     - For the first four hundreds, this is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - In 400-488, '8' appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n     - Total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No page number in 1-488 has '8' in the hundreds place.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

So, starting with the units place for 4. In the units place, 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? The last number is 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in this partial group as well (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems right. Now, moving on to the tens place for 4. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, and the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then each subsequent range adds another 10. So, 5 ranges would be 50. But wait, is 440-449 included? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. Now, what about the hundreds place for 4? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8. Starting with the units place. 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In the partial group, 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, tens place for 8. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Now, how many such full ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four full ranges, each contributing 10 instances. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last range is 480-488. How many numbers are there here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in all 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, adding up units, tens, and hundreds for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and one more in the last partial group, so 49. Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and one more in the last partial group, so 49. Tens place: four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 complete groups (480 numbers) and one partial group (481-488).\n   - In each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 instances: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - So, 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 complete groups and one partial group.\n   - In each group, 8 appears once: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Partial range 480-488 contributes 9 times.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 times.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90 more 4's than 8's.**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. So, if I can figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place. \n\nWait, but maybe it's better to break it down by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try that approach. \n\nStarting with the units place. For each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10, then considering the remainder. But maybe I should think in terms of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me recall a method I've heard before for counting digit occurrences. For a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a specific digit appears can be calculated by looking at higher digits, the current digit, and lower digits. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a simpler approach since the book only has 488 pages, which is manageable.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full tens, and then 8 extra numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in each ten, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), we have 484 as the only number ending with 4. So, that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it's the same logic. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full tens give 48 eights, and the last partial ten (481-488) includes 488, which ends with an 8. So, that's another one, making it 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. So, so far, the count of 4's and 8's in the units place is equal: 49 each.\n\nNow, let's move to the tens place. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, every 100 numbers, there are 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Similarly for 8, it's 80-89, which is another 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nSo, in each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, let's see: the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4's = 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50. 8's = 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit is only up to 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only number ending with 4, so +1. Total 49. That seems correct.\n- 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 488 ends with 8, so +1. Total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: In each full hundred, 10 times. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. Total 50. Correct.\n- 8's: In each full hundred, 10 times. 4 full hundreds, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n- 8's: No hundreds digit is 8, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but when I count the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, 89 times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 4 in the hundreds place appears 100 times for 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 89 times. So, yes.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 401-488, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nUnits place: both 49.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188\n\n8's:49 +49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, yes, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any possibility I double-counted or missed something? Let me check each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumbers ending with 4: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of such numbers is floor((488 -4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10)+1=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. Same count:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: in each hundred, 40-49:10 numbers. 4 hundreds, so 40. Then in 401-488, 440-449:10 numbers. So total 50.\n\nFor 8's: in each hundred, 80-89:10 numbers. 4 hundreds, so 40. Then in 401-488, 480-488:9 numbers. So, 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 times for 4's. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens and one additional occurrence in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, occur once every 10 numbers, with an additional occurrence in 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** In each hundred, 40-49 gives 10 occurrences. With 4 full hundreds and 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** In each hundred, 80-89 gives 10 occurrences. With 4 full hundreds and 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 89 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** No occurrence since the highest page is 488.\n\nSumming these:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count how many 4's appear in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each block of 10, like 8, 18, 28, etc. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole blocks, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once in each block of 10. So, 48 blocks would give 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 484 is in that range, so yes, once more. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 blocks give 48, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is the last one, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 4's and 8's both appear 49 times. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-number block. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). \n\nSo, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers if we count 480 as the first, but actually, it's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. Wait, no, 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial block. \n\nSo, for the tens place: 4's appear 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. 8's appear 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's have 1 more here.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit cycles. \n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each (since 100-199, 200-299, etc.), except for the last partial block if the total pages don't reach the next hundred. \n\nIn this case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (400-488). \n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\n- Digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, the last 8 pages: 481-488. In these, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place: Each 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens digit. 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4's tens: 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8's tens: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4's tens: 40+10=50, 8's tens: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4's hundreds digit: 89. 8's hundreds digit: 0.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits. So, first, single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I should consider both places separately for the digit 4. Let's start with the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for the numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in the range 10-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for every ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, 9 times 4 appears in the units place. So, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. Now, adding that to the single-digit case, which was 1, the total number of 4's so far is 1 + 19 = 20. Now, let's consider the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to check each place for the digit 4. Starting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Next, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 4 in the range 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since we're only going up to 488, the last one is 440-449. Let me check how many sets there are. From 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, in each hundred, the tens digit can be 4, leading to 10 numbers each time. So, for 100-199: 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Then, for 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 40 occurrences in the tens place. Now, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. Let me calculate how many times this happens. For 100-199: The units digit 4 appears in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 times. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times. Now, 400-488: The units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let me count: starting from 404, each 10 numbers. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 times. So, adding up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 39 times in three-digit numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168. So, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times. Adding that to the two-digit and single-digit cases, which were 20, the total number of 4's is 20 + 168 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Again, considering tens and units places. Tens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Units place: The units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. From 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, 9 occurrences. So, in two-digit numbers, 8 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times. Adding to single-digit case, total so far is 1 + 19 = 20. Now, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Let's check each place. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Tens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes only up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each hundred. For 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. Now, units place: The units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. Let's calculate this for each hundred. 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 times. 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 times. 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times. 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences. So, in the units place, 8 appears 39 times. Now, adding up all occurrences of 8 in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78. Adding to the two-digit and single-digit cases, which were 20, the total number of 8's is 20 + 78 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n   - Units place: 9 occurrences (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94).\n   - Total: 19 occurrences.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - Tens place: 40 occurrences (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Units place: 39 occurrences (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 484).\n   - Total: 168 occurrences.\n4. **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n   - Units place: 9 occurrences (e.g., 18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total: 19 occurrences.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Tens place: 39 occurrences (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Units place: 39 occurrences (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 78 occurrences.\n4. **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the single-digit pages, 4 appears once, which is page 4. Now, for the two-digit pages, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of 10 in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But wait, starting from 10-19, the 4 is at 14, then 24, 34, ..., up to 94. That's 9 times. So, units place in two-digit numbers: 9 times. Now, for the three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, the units digit cycles similarly. Each hundred has 10 occurrences where the units digit is 4. For example, 104, 114, ..., 194, then 204, etc., up to 484. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last hundred would be 400-488. So, how many hundreds are there? From 100 to 399 is three hundreds, and then 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. Let me think: For each complete hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit 4 appears 10 times each. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times. Now, for the incomplete hundred, 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, starting from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, units place in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39 times. Wait, but let me check: 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 10 times, 300-399: 10 times. Then 400-488: from 404 to 484, which is every 10 numbers, so (484 - 404)/10 +1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1=9 times. So, yes, 3\u00d710 +9=39. So, total units place 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) = 1+9+39=49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, let's consider how often 4 appears in the tens place. Starting with single-digit pages: there's no tens digit, so 0 times. For two-digit pages, 10-99: the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Now, for three-digit pages, 100-488: the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 4 ranges \u00d710=40 times. Wait, but let me check: 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 4\u00d710=40. So, tens place 4's: two-digit (10) + three-digit (40) = 50 times. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. For single-digit and two-digit pages, there's no hundreds digit, so 0. For three-digit pages, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, that's 89 times. \n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount. For example, in the number 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so it's counted once in units, once in tens, and once in hundreds. So, that's correct. So, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Single-digit pages: 8 appears once, at page 8. Two-digit pages: from 10-99, the units digit is 8 in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 times. Three-digit pages: from 100-488, the units digit is 8 in 108,118,...,198,208,...,298,308,...,398,408,...,488. Let's see how many times. Each hundred has 10 occurrences where units digit is 8, except maybe the last one. From 100-199:108,118,...,198:10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299:10. 300-399:10. Then 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is the last one. So, units place: 3\u00d710 +9=39. So, units place 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) =1+9+39=49.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's. Single-digit: 0. Two-digit: the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. Three-digit: the tens digit is 8 in ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (since 488 is the end). Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the units digit can be 0-8. So, how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for each hundred, except the last one, it's 10 numbers. So, 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 3\u00d710 +9=39. So, tens place 8's: two-digit (10) + three-digit (39) =49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's. Only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: single-digit:1, two-digit:9, three-digit:39. 1+9=10, 10+39=49. Correct.\n- Tens: two-digit:10, three-digit:40. 10+40=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds:400-488:89. Correct.\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Yes.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: single-digit:1, two-digit:9, three-digit:39. 1+9=10, 10+39=49. Correct.\n- Tens: two-digit:10, three-digit:39. 10+39=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds:0. Correct.\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems right because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in three-digit numbers for 4's, we have 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 3\u00d710 +9=39. Correct.\n\nI think the counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Single-digit pages (1-9): 1 occurrence (page 4).\n   - Two-digit pages (10-99): 9 occurrences (14, 24, ..., 94).\n   - Three-digit pages (100-488): 39 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 484).\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Two-digit pages (10-99): 10 occurrences (40-49).\n   - Three-digit pages (100-488): 40 occurrences (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 10 + 40 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Three-digit pages (400-488): 89 occurrences (pages 400 to 488).\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Single-digit pages (1-9): 1 occurrence (page 8).\n   - Two-digit pages (10-99): 9 occurrences (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Three-digit pages (100-488): 39 occurrences (108, 118, ..., 488).\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Two-digit pages (10-99): 10 occurrences (80-89).\n   - Three-digit pages (100-488): 39 occurrences (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 10 + 39 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten pages. Then, this block repeats every hundred numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, from 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 times. From 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10 times. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me count: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. Wait, but from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in every set of ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every ten numbers. How many complete sets of ten are there up to 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, in the last partial set, 8 appears once. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 times. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10 times. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10 times. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10 times. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-99: 10 times. 100-199: 10. 200-299: 10. 300-399: 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because I thought the 8's in the tens place were 49, but let me double-check. Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 188 4's. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again to confirm. Units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) where 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's: Units place, same as 4's: 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 pages where 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the 4's in the hundreds place were 89, which is correct, but the 8's in the tens place only go up to 488, so they are 49. So, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the 8's correctly. From 1-99, 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98. 4's: 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSimilarly, in the 8's, the tens place from 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's there. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nOkay, so I think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which only goes up to 488, but still includes 440-449 (10 numbers).\n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 complete blocks contribute 48 occurrences, and the last 8 pages include 488, adding 1.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - The last block (400-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place for 4's. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at 4). Similarly, from 11 to 20, it appears once at 14, and so on. So, in each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, the last block isn't full. The last page is 488, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers. Does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So, in the units place, we have 48 full blocks contributing 48 fours, plus one more in the incomplete block (484), making it 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for 4's. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds are there up to 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, up to 488, that's four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours from the tens place in the first four hundreds. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488, and 1-7 for 410-479. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 from 401-409, then 1-8 for 410-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, adding that, the tens place gives us 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that include 488? Yes, so 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me check if I did that right. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place for 8's. Similar to 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1-10, 8 appears once (at 8). From 11-20, once at 18, and so on. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there up to 488? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. Now, the last partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place eights: 48 +1 =49.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's. In the tens place, 8 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 80-89, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many hundreds are there up to 488? Four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights from the tens place in the first four hundreds.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding that, the tens place gives us 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from four hundreds) +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the highest page is 488. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188 fours, and for eights, 98 eights. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. So, in each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40 eights. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, making it 49. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 8 never appears because the highest page is 488, so hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, and less than 4 otherwise. So, no eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for fours. I had 50 fours in the tens place. How did that come about? From 40-49 in each hundred, that's 10 fours per hundred, and there are four full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40+10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 49. Because 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and then one more in 484. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any edge cases. For example, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear once every 10 numbers, so up to 488, which is 48 full tens and a partial. So, 48*1=48, plus 1 for 484, so 49. Similarly for 8's, 48 full tens, plus 1 for 488, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for fours, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, making 50. For eights, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, fours have 89, eights have 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one '4'.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488).\n   - In the partial block, 484 contributes one '4'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a sequence (40-49) contributing ten '4's.\n   - Four full blocks (1-400) give 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 contributes ten '4's.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute a '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one '8'.\n   - 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488).\n   - In the partial block, 488 contributes one '8'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a sequence (80-89) contributing ten '8's.\n   - Four full blocks (1-400) give 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 contributes nine '8's.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I can consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For each set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. In each full set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, on page 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: Similarly, for each set of hundred numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the tens place here? Yes, from 440-449, which is ten numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. \n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have overcounted. Because when we count the hundreds place, we're only counting the hundreds digit as 4, so that's correct. But let me think again. For example, in the number 444, we have three 4's, but each digit is counted separately. So, in the units, tens, and hundreds place, each occurrence is counted. So, 444 would contribute to all three counts. So, that's correct. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of ten are there in 488? 48 full sets (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once on page 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each set of hundred numbers, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, does 8 appear in the tens place here? Yes, from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's 9 times, but wait, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount that. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. Then, in the tens place, for 4's, we had 50. Units place: 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. For example, in the units place, when counting 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last partial cycle (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's: units place, same as 4's: 49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in the last partial hundred = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400 to 488 = 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the last partial hundred = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 (since 800-899 exceeds 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, in the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, that's actually part of the 400-488 range. Wait, no, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's an additional 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, from 1-99, the number of 4's in units and tens should be 20 (units: 9 times 1, tens: 9 times 10, but wait, no, in 1-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (4,14,...,84), and tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, 9 + 10 = 19. But earlier, I calculated 49 units and 50 tens from 1-488. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's in each position.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a formula. For a digit d in a certain position, the number of times it appears can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s take N = 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each group contributes 1 four, so 48 * 1 = 48.\n\nThen, the remainder is 488 % 10 = 8. If the remainder is >= 4, we add 1 more four. Since 8 >=4, add 1. So total units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place:\n\nEach group of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, number of complete groups of 100: floor(488 / 100) =4. So, 4 *10=40.\n\nNow, the remainder is 488 % 100=88.\n\nIn the tens place, we look at the tens digit. The current tens digit is 8 (since 88 is in the tens place). We need to see how many fours are there in the tens place up to 88.\n\nIf the tens digit is less than 4, nothing. If it's equal to 4, add the lower digits +1. If it's greater than 4, add 10.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nFor the tens place, the count is:\n\nhigher = floor(N / 100) =4\n\ncurrent = floor((N /10) %10)=8\n\nlower = N %10=8\n\nSo, if current >4: count += (higher +1)*10\n\nif current ==4: count += higher*10 + lower +1\n\nif current <4: count += (higher)*10\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\n\ncurrent = (N //10) %10\n\nlower = N %10\n\nif current > d: count = (higher +1)*10\n\nelif current ==d: count = higher*10 + lower +1\n\nelse: count = higher*10\n\nBut since d is 4, let's apply this.\n\nhigher =488//100=4\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=88//10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current (8) >4, count = (4 +1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nSo, tens place:50.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nhigher =488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current (4) is equal to d (4), count = higher*100 + (lower +1)=0*100 + (88 +1)=89.\n\nSo, hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher =488//10=48\n\nremainder=488%10=8\n\nIf remainder >=8, add 1, else add 0.\n\nSince 8>=8, add 1.\n\nSo, units place:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current (8) >=8, but wait, we're looking for digit 8, so if current >8, which it's not, but equal.\n\nWait, using the formula:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current ==8, count=higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, the formula might be different. Let me think again.\n\nFor digit d=8 in tens place:\n\nIf current >8: but current is 8, so no.\n\nIf current ==8: count= higher*10 + lower +1.\n\nSo, higher=4, lower=8.\n\nSo, 4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current (4) <8, count=higher*100=0.\n\nSo, hundreds place:0.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, not 8, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 8's. Let me recount the 8's.\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488//10=48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remainder is 8, which is >=8, so add 1 more. So, 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: for 8 in tens place, how many times?\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n\nWait, but 480-489 is up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, so from 480-488, the tens digit is still 8, so it's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences, but wait, in the formula earlier, I got 49. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me list the ranges where the tens digit is 8:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-489: but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier count of 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are no page numbers in 800-899. So, hundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, we had 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90 was high, but upon recounting, it seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check the 4's again.\n\nUnits place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 blocks give us 48 fours. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's consider the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in pages 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, and 8 for 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (as before) and 8 extra pages. So, in each full block, 1 eight, so 48 eights. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more eight. So, total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place appears in the block 80-89 in each hundred. So, from 1-100, 80-89 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200, 180-189, another 10, and so on. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds, as before. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Let's see, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights. Wait, but 480-489 would be a full 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 188, and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 full blocks + 1 in 481-488 = 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds *10 =40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 400-488 =89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 +89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 48 full blocks +1 in 488 =49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in 480-488=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, 4 appears once.

For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?

So, in each of the 48 complete sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times.

Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). Each of the 4 complete sets contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is the end, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each ten's digit occurs 10 times except the last one, which is 8 and occurs only 8 times (481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the complete sets) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: This is the third digit from the right. In the range 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 8. That's 48. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place: In each set of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, each 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, I have 98. So, the difference would be 187-98=89. But let me double-check my counting because 98 seems a bit low for 8's, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through the 8's again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 complete sets (1-480) give 48 8's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: As the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 4's total was 187, 8's total is 98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again because 187 seems high. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 times, as each 10 numbers contribute one 4, and 48 complete sets, plus none in the last 8 numbers. So, 48.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 sets give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, 48+50=98; 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 4's and 98 8's. The difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But page 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct.\n\nAnd for the units place, 48 times, correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete sets of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Number of complete sets of 100 in 488: 4.\n   - 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449: 10 times.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete sets of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48.\n   - Additionally, 8 appears once in 488.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Number of complete sets of 100 in 488: 4.\n   - 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488: 9 times.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such sets are there in 488 numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't because 488 is less than 500. So, let's count how many full hundreds we have. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, so that's 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 times. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10 times. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349: 40. 440-449: 50. So yes, 50 times. \n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. \n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, so the units digit is 8 in 488. So that's an extra 1. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check. 0-99: 10, 100-199: 10, 200-299: 10, 300-399: 10, 400-488: 9. So total 49. \n\n3. Hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Then 480-488: that's 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So 40 + 9 = 49. So yes, 49 times in the tens place. Units place was 49, and hundreds place 0, so total 98. \n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Because from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers, so 480 / 10 = 48. Then 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So 48.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times. From 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8, so 48 times. Plus in 488, the units digit is 8, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10*4 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo 187 - 98 = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, but inclusive, so 9 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488 is 187, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears once (at page 14), and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the full blocks. But wait, each full block contributes one 4, so 48 blocks would mean 48 fours. Now, the extra 8 pages (481-488) would include page 484, which has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens digit, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49. Each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many full 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but our extra is only up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8 (for 481-488). So, in this extra block, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's. From 411-420, it's 1, and so on. The only time the tens digit is 4 in this extra block would be in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488? Wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, right? So, from 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 449 is within that range. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the full blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. The extra block is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401 is the first page, and 488 is the last. So, within this, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in this extra block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me think if that's correct. Because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. In the tens place, each 100 numbers have 10 fours, so 4*10=40, plus in the extra 88 pages, 10 more, so 50. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in the last 8 pages (484), so 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. So, each 100-number block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the extra block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So, in this extra block, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but our range is only up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is in 401-488? Wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 401 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 480 is within 401-488. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is included? Wait, 401-488 includes 480, right? Because 480 is greater than 401. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, that's 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place. In the extra block (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, 4*10=40, plus 9, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the extra block, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. So, 4*10=40, plus 10, total 50.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the count for 4's in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, which is one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 48 full blocks, 48 8's, plus one more in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I subtract 98 from 188, I get 90. But I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400-488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 8's in the tens place again. In the extra block (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as 480 is included. So, 9 times. So, total 49.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 8's in the tens place. Each 100-number block has 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40. Then, the extra block (401-488) gives 9 more, so 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a 488-page book, the page numbers range from 001 to 488 if we consider leading zeros, but since we're not using leading zeros, we have to adjust accordingly.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of three-digit numbers, padding with leading zeros for numbers less than 100. So, pages 1-9 would be 001-009, 10-99 as 010-099, and 100-488 as 100-488. This might make it easier to count each digit place.\n\nSo, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- For each digit from 0-9, it appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial block.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete block, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, digit 4 appears 48 times, and digit 8 appears 48 times.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, digit 4 appears once (484), and digit 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place (e.g., 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99).\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 100: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), with a remaining block of 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete block of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, digit 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and digit 8 appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nIn the remaining block (401-488), we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n\n- 481-490: tens digit 8\n\nBut since we only go up to 488, the last partial group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in 441-450: 10 numbers, but wait, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\n- Digit 8 appears in 481-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, which is 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, that's 8 numbers, each with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but now I'm seeing it's 8. Wait, let me count: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 8 numbers. So, digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the extra block.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier. So, in the tens place, in the extra block (401-488), digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50\n\n- 8's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 8 = 48\n\nWait, so earlier I thought digit 8 in the tens place was 49, but now it's 48. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount. In the extra block (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in the tens place in the extra block is 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, that changes the total count.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\n- 8's: There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nWait, so the total 8's are 97, not 98 as I previously thought. So, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 90, but now it's 91. Which is correct?\n\nLet me recast the counts:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place were 49, but now I'm seeing it's 48. So, the correct total 8's are 97, making the difference 91.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. In the extra block (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 occurrences. So, in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from the 4 blocks) + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, units: 49, tens: 48, hundreds: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, inclusive, how many pages is that?\n\n488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 8's in the tens place again. When I thought of 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in the extra block.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 because I miscounted. Let me clarify: from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, that would mean in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from the 4 blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 numbers, but actually, 480 is included, making it 9 numbers. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n480: yes, it's within 401-488.\n\n481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488.\n\nSo, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, so now I'm back to 90. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether 480 is included in the extra block (401-488). Since 480 is greater than 401, it is included. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nThus, in the tens place, 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought it was 8 numbers, I got 97 8's, leading to a difference of 91. But now, with 9 numbers, it's 98 8's, leading to 90 difference.\n\nI think the correct count is 9 numbers, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm with another approach. Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: Each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, total 49.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 4 full blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. In the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50.\n\n- For 8's: Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 4 full blocks contribute 4*10=40. In the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\n- For 8's: No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent now. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10 numbers. Each set has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers. In this range, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNow, the tens place: Similarly, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409. Wait, but 400-409 is within 488, so that's five sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, from 400-409, that's only 10 numbers, but 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range. So, that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. However, I need to check if 488 is included. Since 400-409 is within 488, it's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 onwards up to 488, so yes, 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place are 89.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1-480, that's 48 sets, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 is present once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49. Tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, yes, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 400-409. Wait, 400-409 is only 10 numbers, but 400-488 includes more. Wait, no, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, right? Wait, no, the tens digit in 400-409 is 0, not 4. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Oh no, I think I confused the hundreds and tens digits. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, when I'm counting the tens digit as 4, it's in the tens place, so the numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is beyond 488? No, 440-449 is within 488. So, that's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nFor 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnd units place for 8's: from 1-480, 48 times, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me confirm. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, when I count the units digit, I'm only considering the last digit, not the other digits. Similarly, for tens and hundreds. So, each digit place is counted separately, so no overlaps. So, the total counts are accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit position, how many times does 4 and 8 appear.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total sets of 10 in 488 numbers: 48 full sets (since 48 x 10 = 480), plus 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times plus 1 if 488 is included, but in the units place, 488 has 8, not 4. So, units digit 4's: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 full sets, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once (at 488). So, 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor 4's: Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 x 10 = 40 times. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit can also be 4. So, yes, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: from 1-400, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.), so 4 x 10 = 40. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's: none, since the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit doesn't reach 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. From 481-488, no additional 4's. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400: 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) = 40 times. From 400-488: 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place: 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1-480: 48 times. From 481-488: 488 adds 1. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. From 1-400: 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40 times. From 400-488: 480-488 adds 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and a partial set of 8 numbers. So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial set is from 481 to 488, right? So, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNow, let's move to the tens place. Similarly, in every set of a hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly ten times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, it's 40-49, which is ten numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the remaining pages are from 401-488. In the tens place, how many 4's are there? Let's see: 440-449 would be ten numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another ten 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, we have four hundreds, each contributing ten 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is ten more. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. \n\nWait, but hold on, does 400 count as a page? Yes, because the first page is 1 and the last is 488, so 400 is included. So, from 400-488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. \n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. \n\nStarting with units place: just like with 4, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit here is 8. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNow, tens place: in every set of a hundred numbers, the digit 8 appears ten times in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many hundreds are there? Four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes ten 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but wait, our upper limit is 488, so it's 480-488, which is nine numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's nine 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488 is nine numbers. So, nine 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nNow, hundreds place: the digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, total 8's printed: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. \n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. \n\nFirst, for 4's: units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last set from 481-488, which includes 484, so one more, total 49. Tens place: four full hundreds, each contributing ten 4's, so 40, plus from 401-488, 440-449 is ten 4's, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\nFor 8's: units place: 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: four full hundreds, each contributing ten 8's, so 40, plus from 401-488, 480-488 is nine 8's, so 49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nSubtracting, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the difference is 90. \n\nI think that's correct. But let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit place separately and ensuring I haven't missed any numbers. \n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place and sum them up. Let me try that approach again to confirm. \n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each ten numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens? 48 full tens and a partial of 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nTens place: For each hundred numbers, 4 appears ten times in the tens place. So, four full hundreds, each contributing ten, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is ten numbers, so 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. \n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full tens plus one in the last partial, so 49. \n\nTens place: Four full hundreds, each contributing ten 8's in the tens place, so 40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488 is nine numbers, so nine 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nHundreds place: None, as before. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every set of ten numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets (480 numbers) and a partial set of 8 (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every hundred, 4 appears ten times (e.g., 40-49). Four full hundreds contribute 40 fours. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 fours. Total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 fours.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 48 complete sets and one in the partial set (488), totaling 49 eights.\n   - **Tens Place:** Four full hundreds contribute 40 eights. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 eights. Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No eights appear here as the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of eights from fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I can do the same for the digit 8. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place. \n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, actually, the units place in the 49th set (480-489) would have a 4 in 484. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in that set, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-479) plus 1 (484) equals 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Now, the next block is 401-500, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check how many fours are in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers (440-449), so another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 of these numbers. Therefore, hundreds place fours: 89.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. But wait, the last partial set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. In that set, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens place, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-100, 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189, another 10, and so on. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, the next block is 401-500, but we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, how many eights is that? Each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, one 4. 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last set (480-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, 10 fours in the tens place. 488 /100 =4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the next block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, one 8. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last set (480-488), 488 has an 8 in units place, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, 10 eights in the tens place. 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the next block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No numbers with hundreds digit 8, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check that again. In the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 8 appear? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, yes, that's correct. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers are there? The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full decades plus the 49th term (488). So, 49 times, which matches the earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, it's every 100 numbers, 10 times, plus the extra in the last partial hundred. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place in 8's, there are none because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers have one '4' in the units place.  \n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (1-479) + 1 extra in 480-488 (484).  \n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).  \n   - Total in 400 pages: 4 sets of 100 (1-400) \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In 401-488, '4' appears in 440-449 (10 numbers).  \n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total '4's: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers have one '8' in the units place.  \n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (1-479) + 1 extra in 480-488 (488).  \n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).  \n   - Total in 400 pages: 4 sets of 100 (1-400) \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In 401-488, '8' appears in 480-488 (9 numbers).  \n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Same with 8's. So, for each digit place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 pages. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, in 48 complete groups, the units digit 4 appears 48 times, and the same for 8. Now, the extra 8 pages would be from 481 to 488. Let's see, in the units place here, 484 is the only number where the units digit is 4, and 488 has 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero. \n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. For the tens digit, it cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 400 pages would be four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the four complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, let's check the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. Tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. The difference here is 50 - 49 = 1. \n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, so pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. From 100 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book, so 8 never appears there. So, yes, 8's in hundreds place: 0. \n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the tens place correctly for 8 in the incomplete hundred. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times, which I think I accounted for correctly. \n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. \n\nSo, adding up, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's. \n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. \n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many such numbers? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence of 4 in the units place, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is page 484, which is the 48th 4 in the units place, and then 490 would be next, but since we only go up to 488, maybe I overcounted. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the extra 8 pages from 481-488: 484 is within that range, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units digit 4's: 49. Similarly, units digit 8's: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8, so 49 total. So that part is correct. \n\nIn the tens place, for the complete hundreds, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40+10=50. For 8 in the tens place, in each complete hundred, it's 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So, that's correct. \n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times, as 488 - 400 +1 = 89. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's. \n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When we count page numbers, each page has a unique number, so 400 to 488 is indeed 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 pages. In 488 pages, there are 48 full groups of 10 and an extra 8 pages.\n   - 48 full groups: 48 occurrences.\n   - Extra pages (481-488): 484 contributes one more.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Similarly, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for each digit.\n   - Incomplete hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n     - 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count the number of 4's in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Same for 8's. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place: For 4's in the units place, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, for 8's in the units place: Similarly, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full blocks give 48 times, and the partial block (481-488) has 8 in the units place once (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the difference here is zero. Now, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488). In each full block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 times. So, total 50.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place: Similarly, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 times here. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. \n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n4's: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then 481-488: 484 is the only 4 in units, so +1, total 49. That seems right.\n\n8's: Similarly, 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then 481-488: 488 is the only 8 in units, so +1, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 4 full centuries (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then 401-488: 440-449, which is 10, so total 50. Correct.\n\n8's: 4 full centuries, each contributing 10, so 40. Then 401-488: 480-488, which is 9, so total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\n8's: None, since 800 is beyond 488. So 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which includes 40 from the first four centuries and 10 from 440-449. That seems right.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 each, so no difference there.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49, so 1 more 4.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 more 4's, so total difference is 89 + 1 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480 is within 401-488? No, 480 is less than 401. Wait, no, 480 is 480, which is less than 401? Wait, no, 480 is 480, which is less than 401? Wait, 401 is 401, so 480 is 480, which is after 401. Wait, no, 480 is less than 401? No, 480 is greater than 401. Wait, 401 is 401, 480 is 480, which is after 401. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. But 480 is 480, which is within 401-488? No, 480 is less than 401? Wait, 401 is 401, and 480 is 480, which is higher, so 480 is within 401-488? No, 480 is less than 401? Wait, 480 is 480, which is less than 401? No, 480 is higher than 401. Wait, 401 is 401, so 480 is 480, which is higher, so 480 is within 401-488? No, 480 is less than 401? Wait, no, 480 is higher than 401. Wait, 401 is 401, so 480 is 480, which is higher, so 480 is within 401-488? No, 480 is less than 401? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, 401 is 401, and 480 is 480, which is higher, so 480 is within 401-488? No, 480 is less than 401? No, 480 is higher than 401. So, 480 is within 401-488? No, because 480 is less than 401? Wait, no, 480 is higher than 401. Wait, 401 is 401, 480 is 480, so 480 is after 401, so it's within 401-488. Therefore, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's correct, 9 times. So, 40 from the full centuries plus 9 in the partial, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 480 is less than 401, which is incorrect. 480 is higher than 401, so it's included in the 401-488 range. So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49, so 1 more 4.\n\nHundreds place: 89 more 4's.\n\nSo, total difference: 89 + 1 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 484 has a 4 in units, so +1, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus 488, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) = 4 full centuries, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488): in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488 / 100) = 4 full centuries, each contributing 10, so 40. Remaining 88 numbers: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 1000) = 0 full thousands, but the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so +89, total 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, and 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, same result. So, I think 90 is correct. But let me try another way to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: As before, 49.\n\nNumber of 8's: 49.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: 49.\n\nDifference: 1.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0.\n\nDifference: 89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot, but given that the hundreds place contributes 89, which is a large number, it makes sense.\n\nAnother way: Let's list out the page numbers and count, but that's impractical for 488 pages. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nIn the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, every time the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers per hundred, so 400/100 = 4 times 10, but in the last partial hundred, 440-449, which is another 10, so 50.\n\nIn the units place, 4's appear once every 10 numbers, so 48 times in the first 480 pages, plus 484, so 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's, but they don't appear in the hundreds place, only in tens and units.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 90 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0.\n\nSo, the difference in hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nIn tens place, 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nUnits place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\nTotal difference: 89 + 1 + 0 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've checked it enough ways. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many full sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more in the 484th page, right? Wait, no, because 481-488 is the 49th set, but it's only 8 numbers. So, in the units place, it's 48 times from the full sets plus one more in 484, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because 484 is part of the 480-489 set, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 occurs once in 484. So, units place: 48 times from 1-480, plus one more in 484, totaling 49 times.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each full ten numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, how many tens are there? 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs once in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 in 480-488 is still present in the tens place for 480-488, right? So, let me count how many times the tens digit is 4.\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 times\nFrom 140-149: 10 times\nFrom 240-249: 10 times\nFrom 340-349: 10 times\nFrom 440-449: 10 times\nFrom 480-488: The tens digit is 8, so the tens digit is 8 here, not 4. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, the tens digit 4 only occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all of these, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: In every set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, contributing 48 times, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488), where the units digit 8 occurs once in 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. So, for example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is 9 times? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 times. So, how many blocks? Let's see:\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 times\nFrom 180-189: 10 times\nFrom 280-289: 10 times\nFrom 380-389: 10 times\nFrom 480-488: 9 times\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place for 4: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48, plus 484, which is in 481-488, so that's 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 400-488: that's 89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 4's or 8's.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1 if the remainder is >=4). Wait, perhaps a better formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for units digit, it's (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. For units digit, the number of times d appears is:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). But wait, that's only if d is less than or equal to 9, which it is. Wait, but for d=4, it's the number of complete decades (n//10) plus 1 if the last digit is >=4. So, for n=488, units digit 4's: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: units digit: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of times d appears in tens place up to n is:\n\nnumber = (n // 100) * 10 + (if (n % 100) >= d*10, then (n % 100 - d*10 +1), else 0). Wait, perhaps a better way.\n\nAlternatively, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in 0-99, 40-49:10 times. In 100-199, 140-149:10 times, etc.\n\nSo, for n=488, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (0-399), and then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449:10 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But according to this, 4 hundreds (0-399) would have 4 blocks, and 440-449 in 400-488, making it 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89:10 times. So, how many hundreds are there up to 488? 4 hundreds (0-399), and in 400-488, 480-488:9 times. So, 4*10 + 9=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's: 800-888 would be needed, but since n=488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to break it down by the number of digits. So, single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is page 4. So, single-digit: 1 occurrence. Now, two-digit numbers: 10-99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. The tens digit can be 4, so numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Then, the units place. For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 occurrences. So, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Now, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488. Let's break this down. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each of these, the hundreds digit being 4 will affect the count. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, that's from 400 to 488. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. For the tens place, we can have 4 in any of the hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Let's handle each group separately.\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit can be 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the limit. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: Now, we need to check up to 488. So, units digit 4 would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, when I added the hundreds, tens, and units for three-digit numbers, I got 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then adding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So total 4's would be 20 + 168 = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers, each hundreds group (100-199, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are 4 such groups, so 40, which is correct.\n\nIn the units place, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10, so 30, and 400-488 contributes 9, so total 39. So, 39 is correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then single-digit 1, two-digit 19, so 1 + 19 = 20. 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, at page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 8 appears once per group. There are 9 groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 can only be in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's check each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: Tens digit 8 is in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488. Let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each hundreds group, the units digit 8 appears once per ten's group.\n\n1. 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 208,218,...,298: 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: from 408 to 488, stepping by 10. 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:39+39=78. So, 1+19=20, plus 78 is 98. So, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the counts. Let me go through each part again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit: tens (10) + units (9) =19\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) =168\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit: tens (10) + units (9)=19\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39)=78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me check that again. In the three-digit numbers, for units place, each hundreds group (100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. So, 100-199:104,114,...,194:10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. Then for 400-488, the units digit 4 would be 404,414,...,484. How many is that? Let's see: starting at 404, each 10 pages, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last before 488. So, 9 occurrences. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in three-digit numbers for 4's, each hundreds group has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But wait, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 in each group, 4 groups, so 40. That's correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place in three-digit numbers for 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute because we don't have 800-899. The tens place in three-digit numbers: 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's in three-digit numbers: 100-199:108,118,...,198 (10), 200-299:208,...,298 (10), 300-399:308,...,398 (10), 400-488:408,418,...,488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit position separately.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last digit if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate for each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nFor units digit, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each full set of 10 numbers. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so for digits 0-8, each appears 48 times in the units place, and 9 appears 48 times as well, but the last number is 488, which is 8, so 9 would have 48 occurrences, and 8 would have 49? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 complete sets, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for digits 0-9, each appears 48 times in the units place, and then in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so each of these digits (1-8) appears once more. So, digits 1-8 each have 48 +1=49 occurrences in the units place, and 9 has 48 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 has units digit 8, so 8 appears one more time. So, in units place, 8 appears 49 times, others as per.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nFor each digit d from 0-9, the number of times it appears in the units place is:\n\n- For d=0: It appears once every 10 numbers, but starting from 10, so from 10,20,...,480. So, 48 times (since 480 is the 48th multiple of 10). But 480 is included, so 48 times.\n\n- For d=1: Appears at 1,11,21,...,481. How many? From 1 to 488, the last number is 488, so 481 is included. So, how many times? The first occurrence is 1, then every 10 numbers. So, (488 -1)/10 +1 = (487)/10 +1=48.7, so 48 full occurrences, but since 481 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, no, wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit 1 appears at 1,11,21,...,481. So, how many terms? The sequence is 1,11,...,481. The nth term is 1 +10(n-1). So, 1 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u21d210(n-1) \u2264487 \u21d2n-1 \u226448.7 \u21d2n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for d=2, it's 2,12,22,...,482. The last term is 482, which is \u2264488. So, same as above, 49 times.\n\nSame for d=3: 3,13,...,483: 49 times.\n\nd=4:4,14,...,484:49 times.\n\nd=5:5,15,...,485:49 times.\n\nd=6:6,16,...,486:49 times.\n\nd=7:7,17,...,487:49 times.\n\nd=8:8,18,...,488:49 times.\n\nd=9:9,19,...,489. But 489 is beyond 488, so the last occurrence is 489-10=479. So, 9,19,...,479. How many terms? The nth term is 9 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u21d210(n-1) \u2264479 \u21d2n-1 \u226447.9 \u21d2n=48. So, 48 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last number, so 488 is included. So, for d=8, the last occurrence is 488, so it's 49 times, as above.\n\nSo, in units place:\n\n- 4 appears 49 times.\n\n- 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 39 in three-digit numbers and 9 in two-digit numbers, totaling 48? Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nAs above, 4 appears 49 times in units place.\n\n8 appears 49 times in units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for each set of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (from 1-10: tens digit 0, 10-19:1, etc.), but actually, from 1-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 each 10 times, but starting from 10. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of complete hundreds.\n\nIn each hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4\u00d710=40 times each digit appears in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place in 401-488.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410:10 numbers, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but 401-410: the tens digit is 0, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 1:411-420:10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 2:421-430:10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 3:431-440:10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 4:441-450:10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 5:451-460:10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 6:461-470:10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 7:471-480:10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 8:481-488:8 numbers (since 488 is the last number).\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit:\n\n- 0:10\n\n- 1:10\n\n- 2:10\n\n- 3:10\n\n- 4:10\n\n- 5:10\n\n- 6:10\n\n- 7:10\n\n- 8:8\n\nSo, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears 8 times.\n\nNow, adding to the previous 40 times each from 1-400.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's:40 +10=50\n\n- 8's:40 +8=48\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting manually, I had different numbers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4:441-450:10 numbers.\n\n- Tens digit 8:481-488:8 numbers.\n\nSo, total for 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times.\n\n- 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, digits can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nEach digit from 1-3 appears 100 times each in the hundreds place (from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). So, 100 each for 1,2,3.\n\nDigit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, in hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- 8 appears 0 times, since we don't have 800-899.\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:48\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 98. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought 8 appears 49 times, but according to this digit-by-digit analysis, it's 49. But earlier, when I counted manually, I got 98 total 8's, which included 1 (single-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit). Let me see where that might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit approach, the total 8's are 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the manual count, I got 98. So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check where.\n\nWait, perhaps in the manual count, I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the manual count.\n\nIn the manual count:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit: tens (10) + units (9)=19.\n\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39)=78.\n\nTotal:1+19+78=98.\n\nBut according to the digit-by-digit approach, it's 97. So, where is the error?\n\nWait, perhaps in the three-digit units place for 8's, I counted 39, but according to the digit-by-digit, it's 49 (units) +48 (tens)=97.\n\nWait, let me check the manual count for three-digit units place.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, units digit 8:\n\n- 100-199:108,118,...,198:10 numbers.\n\n- 200-299:208,...,298:10 numbers.\n\n- 300-399:308,...,398:10 numbers.\n\n- 400-488:408,418,...,488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, in tens place:\n\n- 100-199:180-189:10 numbers.\n\n- 200-299:280-289:10 numbers.\n\n- 300-399:380-389:10 numbers.\n\n- 400-488:480-488:9 numbers.\n\nTotal:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, in manual count, three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nPlus single-digit 1, two-digit 19: total 98.\n\nBut according to the digit-by-digit approach, it's 97.\n\nWait, perhaps the digit-by-digit approach is missing something. Let me check the units place.\n\nFrom 1-488, units digit 8 appears 49 times, as per the digit-by-digit approach.\n\nBut in the manual count, units digit 8 in three-digit numbers is 39, plus in two-digit numbers, units digit 8 is 9, plus single-digit 8:1. So, total units digit 8's:39+9+1=49, which matches the digit-by-digit approach.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8's: in three-digit numbers, 39, plus in two-digit numbers, 10, plus in single-digit numbers, 0. So, total tens digit 8's:39+10=49. Wait, but in the digit-by-digit approach, it's 48. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, according to the digit-by-digit approach, tens digit 8's are 48. But according to manual count, it's 39 (three-digit) +10 (two-digit)=49.\n\nWhere is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me recount the tens digit 8's.\n\nIn the digit-by-digit approach, for the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488: tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nBut in the manual count, I have 10 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps in the manual count, I included an extra 8 in the tens place somewhere.\n\nWait, in two-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 is from 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 is:\n\n- 180-189:10\n\n- 280-289:10\n\n- 380-389:10\n\n- 480-488:8\n\nTotal:10+10+10+8=38, not 39.\n\nAh, there's the mistake! Earlier, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but it's actually 9 numbers from 480 to 488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers, but in terms of tens digit 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the digit-by-digit approach, it's 8 occurrences. Wait, no, in the digit-by-digit approach, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. But in the digit-by-digit approach, I thought it was 8. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit approach, I said:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But that's incorrect because 480 is included in 401-488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, the correct count is 9, not 8.\n\nSo, in the digit-by-digit approach, I should have:\n\nFrom 401-488, tens digit 8:9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total tens digit 8's:40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nWhich matches the manual count.\n\nWait, so earlier, I thought in the digit-by-digit approach that from 401-488, tens digit 8 appears 8 times, which was incorrect. It's actually 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's:40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (tens) +49 (units)=98, plus hundreds digit 0. So, total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but earlier in the digit-by-digit approach, I thought it was 97, but that was because I incorrectly counted 8 occurrences in 401-488 for tens digit 8, whereas it's actually 9.\n\nSo, correcting that, total 8's:49 (tens) +49 (units)=98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nTens digit:50\n\nUnits digit:49\n\nHundreds digit:89\n\nTotal 4's:50+49+89=188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding how many more '4's there are than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: '4' appears in 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n     - Units place: '4' appears once in each ten's group (10-19, ..., 90-99) \u2192 9 times.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: '4' appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n     - Tens place: '4' appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 each \u2192 40 times.\n     - Units place: '4' appears once in each hundred's group and 9 times in 400-488 \u2192 39 times.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** '8' appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: '8' appears in 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n     - Units place: '8' appears once in each ten's group \u2192 9 times.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Tens place: '8' appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10,10,10,9 \u2192 39 times.\n     - Units place: '8' appears once in each hundred's group and 9 times in 400-488 \u2192 39 times.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I can do the same for 8's. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 100, then multiplying by 10, and then considering the remainder.\n\nFor the hundreds place, it's similar but cycles every 1000 pages. Since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit will only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place by considering how many full hundreds are in 488 and then the remaining pages.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this systematically. Let me first handle the units place for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nFor units digit 4:\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place = Total pages // 10 * 1 (since each 10 pages have one 4 in units place) + min(Total pages % 10, 4's position). Wait, actually, it's better to think that in every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total number of 4's in units place is (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48 full tens, so 48 times 1, which is 48. But then, in the remaining 8 pages (since 48*10=480, so pages 481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place in these remaining pages? Yes, at page 484. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more, at 484. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in units place = (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >=8 else 0). So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that's the same as 4's in units place. Hmm, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, the difference in units place is 0. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 440-449, because 450-459 would be beyond 488? Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 is also within 488, up to 488. Wait, no, 440-449 is the first set, then 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, so for the tens digit 4, how many times does it appear?\n\nEach set of 100 pages has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total number of times 4 appears in tens place is 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 8:\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, so let's see:\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89:10 numbers.\n\n100-199:180-189:10.\n\n200-299:280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488: let's see, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, for the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, total number of times 8 appears in tens place is 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 50 times in tens place, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference in tens place is 50 -49=1.\n\nSo, so far, in units place, both have 49, so no difference. In tens place, 4's are one more. So, total so far, 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 8:\n\nWait, since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 -0=89.\n\nSo, adding up the differences from each digit place:\n\nUnits place: 0\n\nTens place: +1\n\nHundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so +1, total 49.\n\nFor 8's: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so +1, total 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, total 5 sets, 50.\n\nFor 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, 50 vs 49, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, 89-0=89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that 4 appears 90 more times than 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **Digit 4:** Occurs once every 10 numbers. Total occurrences = (488 // 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Digit 8:** Similarly, occurs once every 10 numbers. Total occurrences = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Difference:** 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **Digit 4:** Occurs in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks up to 488. Total = 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Digit 8:** Occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 full blocks and an additional 9 occurrences in 480-488. Total = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Difference:** 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **Digit 4:** Appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. Total = 89.\n   - **Digit 8:** Does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total = 0.\n   - **Difference:** 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 and then see if there are any extra numbers beyond that. \n\nWait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10, so I have to adjust for that. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more in the units place (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. How many times does 4 appear in the tens digit? Well, each block of 100 numbers has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, let's see how many complete hundreds are there in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear here? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, but each contributes one 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 is 89, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's. I'll start with the units place. How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8's. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 instances where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (400-799, but we only go up to 488), each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full centuries, each contributing 10 8's, so 40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last. So, that's correct, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nAnd for the units place, 488 is included, so 8 appears once more, making it 49. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. \n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place: For every ten numbers, 4 appears once. So from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). Each set has one number ending with 4, so that's 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated. Let me think about how to count the 4's here. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. \n\nWait, but I'm counting the digit 4, so I should see how often 4 appears in each place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: For numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100-488. \n\nLet's break this down. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449. Wait, but 449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers as well.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but hold on. When we reach 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). But for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times.\n\nNow, the units place: In three-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 100-488?\n\nLet me think. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 4 appears once every ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred. But since we have four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), let's check each.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit is 4 for 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit is 4 for 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count these. Starting at 404, each subsequent 10 numbers adds another 4 in the units place. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (0-8), the units digit 4 appears once. Since the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (because 488 is the last page), that's 9 tens digits (0-8), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times. Therefore, total units digit 4's in 400-488 is 9.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 units digit 4's, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, from 400-488, it's 9. So, 30 + 9 = 39. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) is 168.\n\nSo, total 4's in all page numbers: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nHmm, so 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. Let's count 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: For every ten numbers, 8 appears once. So from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 times.\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488. Let's count 8's in hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899. But our book goes only up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTens place: Let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. Wait, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units place from 100-488?\n\nAgain, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundred, 8 appears once every ten numbers. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit is 8 for 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit is 8 for 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count these. Starting at 408, each subsequent 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me add them up: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, plus 9 is 39. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the hundreds place had 0, so total 8's in three-digit numbers are tens (39) + units (39) = 78.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For three-digit numbers, we have:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, total 8's in all page numbers: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 78. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my counting.\n\nLet me go through the 4's again:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49 (10), units place 14,24,...,94 (9), total 19\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 (89)\n- Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (10 each, total 40)\n- Units place: 104,114,...,194 (10), 204,...,294 (10), 304,...,394 (10), 404,...,484 (9), total 39\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39 = 188. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, no, I think I added it wrong earlier. Wait, single-digit is 1, two-digit is 19, three-digit is 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. So, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89 (10), units place 18,28,...,98 (9), total 19\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (10,10,10,9) total 39\n- Units place: 108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10), 308,...,398 (10), 408,...,488 (9) total 39\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 39 + 39 = 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big number, 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this, maybe by using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count how many 4's and 8's appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last one if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nIn units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 in 488: 48 full groups (480 pages), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 (complete groups) \u00d7 1 (for each group) + check if 484 is within the remaining 8 pages. 484 is 484, which is within 481-488, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 39 for three-digit numbers. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try to compute the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal number of pages: 488.\n\nFor units digit, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times for each digit, plus an extra 8 pages (481-488), which have units digits 1-8.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place:\n\nNumber of times = 48 (from complete groups) + 1 if 4 \u2264 8, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place:\n\nNumber of times = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 39 for three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the units place, from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down by hundreds, I got 39 for three-digit units digit 4's. That must be incorrect because this method suggests it's 49.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier breakdown. Let me try again.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct number of 4's in the units place is 49, and similarly for 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the tens place every 100 pages, 10 times each.\n\nTotal number of complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nWait, but 400-488 is not a complete hundred, it's 89 pages.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times.\n\nSo, for each complete hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit 0-8, how many times does it appear? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 pages), 1 for 410-419 (10), ..., up to 8 for 480-488 (9 pages, since 488 is the last).\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\nFor each complete hundred (100-199, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n\nFor 400-488, digits 0-8 appear 10 times each except for 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 pages), 1 for 410-419 (10), 2 for 420-429 (10), ..., 7 for 470-479 (10), and 8 for 480-488 (9 pages). So, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit counts:\n\nFor each complete hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399): each digit 0-9 appears 10 times, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times for each digit.\n\nFor 400-488: digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 30 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488, since 4 is between 0-7) = 40.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8's: 30 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39 for tens digit 8's in three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but according to this, the tens digit 4's are 40, and 8's are 39.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I have 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nEach digit 1-4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 100-199: 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 200-299: 2 appears 100 times.\n\nFor 300-399: 3 appears 100 times.\n\nFor 400-488: 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4's: 89 times.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: 0 times, since we don't have 800-899 pages.\n\nSo, total hundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 40\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 188. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when breaking it down by hundreds, tens, and units in three-digit numbers. Let me see.\n\nWait, according to this method, units place 4's: 49, tens place 4's: 40, hundreds place 4's: 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nBut earlier, when I broke it down by single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I got 188.\n\nI must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let's check the units place again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach complete group of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. There are 48 complete groups in 480 pages (since 480/10=48). Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nEach complete hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. There are 3 complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times for each digit. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 for each digit.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8, with 0-7 each appearing 10 times (400-409, 410-419, etc.), and 8 appearing 9 times (480-488). So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in the incomplete hundred (since 4 is between 0-7). So, total tens digit 4's: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\nBut earlier, when I broke it down by single-digit, two-digit, three-digit, I got 188. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the single-digit, two-digit, three-digit breakdown.\n\nLet me recount that.\n\nSingle-digit numbers: 1-9.\n\n4 appears once (page 4).\n\n8 appears once (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\n4's in tens place: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n4's in units place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 tens, so 9 times.\n\nTotal 4's in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in two-digit:\n\n8's in tens place: 80-89, 10 times.\n\n8's in units place: 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\n4's in hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n4's in tens place: Let's see, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, 10.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, 10 \u00d7 4 = 40.\n\n4's in units place: For each hundred, in the units place, 4 appears once every ten numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 204,...,294: 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 304,...,394: 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 404,414,...,484: Let's see, starting at 404, each 10 numbers adds another 4 in the units place. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It should be floor(89/10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 89 divided by 10 is 8 with remainder 9. So, 8 full cycles (8 \u00d7 1 = 8) plus 1 more (since 4 \u2264 9), so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nBut according to the digit position method, it's 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\nThere's a discrepancy of 10. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps in the digit position method, I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, 4 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nBut in the other method, I got 188. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit position method. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 pages. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 480/10=48). Each group contributes one 4. So, 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 3 complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contribute 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 30 + 10 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nBut in the other method, I got 188. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the other method, I double-counted something.\n\nWait, when I broke it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, perhaps I included page numbers beyond 488. Wait, no, because three-digit numbers go up to 488.\n\nWait, let me check the three-digit 4's again.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 times.\n\nTens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 10 each, total 40.\n\nUnits place: 104,114,...,194: 10\n\n204,...,294:10\n\n304,...,394:10\n\n404,...,484:9\n\nTotal units 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nAdding single-digit 1 and two-digit 19: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nBut according to the digit position method, it's 178. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit position method. Let me check the units place again.\n\nWait, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 pages: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo, how many terms are there in the sequence 4,14,24,...,484?\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where a1=4, d=10.\n\nThe nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 4 +10(n-1).\n\nWe need the last term \u2264488.\n\n4 +10(n-1) \u2264488\n\n10(n-1) \u2264484\n\nn-1 \u226448.4\n\nn \u226449.4, so n=49.\n\nSo, 49 times. So, units digit 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 3 complete hundreds: 30, plus 10 in 400-488: total 40.\n\nHundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nBut in the other method, I get 188. There's a difference of 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps in the two-digit numbers, I overcounted.\n\nWait, in two-digit numbers, 4's in the tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\n4's in the units place: 14,24,...,94: that's 9 numbers because 94 is the last two-digit number. Wait, no, 94 is the 9th term in the sequence 14,24,...,94. So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSimilarly, in three-digit numbers, units digit 4's: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers.\n\n204,...,294:10\n\n304,...,394:10\n\n404,...,484:9\n\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but in the digit position method, units digit 4's: 49, which includes single-digit (4) and all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps in the single-digit, two-digit, three-digit method, I included the single-digit 4 as part of the units digit 4's, which is correct. So, in the digit position method, units digit 4's include all single-digit and three-digit units digit 4's.\n\nSo, in the single-digit, two-digit, three-digit method, units digit 4's are 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49. Which matches the digit position method.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 4's: in two-digit numbers: 10 (40-49), and in three-digit numbers: 40 (from 140-149, etc.), so total 50.\n\nBut in the digit position method, tens digit 4's are 40. So, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, no, in the digit position method, tens digit 4's are 40, which includes both two-digit and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in two-digit numbers, tens digit 4's: 10 (40-49).\n\nIn three-digit numbers, tens digit 4's: 40"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. How many full groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let me see how many hundreds are there in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred (401-488). \n\nFor each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. That's another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, because 440 is less than 488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but hold on, is 488 included? Let me check. The last page is 488, so the partial hundred is up to 488. So, 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 times. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate that. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. \n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in every group of 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, similar to 4's, in 488 numbers, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (480 numbers) and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each full group, units digit 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the partial group, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit 8 appears in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these is 10 numbers. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? \n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. \n\nWait, but 480-489 is a full set, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, when calculating the tens place for 8's, I considered 4 full hundreds (1-400) and the partial hundred 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, we had 48 full groups (each contributing 1) and the last partial group contributing 1, so 49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. \n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, we had 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears at 484, so 1 more. Total units: 49. Tens place: in each full hundred, 10 times, so 4 full hundreds give 40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place: 48 full groups, 48, plus 1 in the last partial group (488), so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total tens: 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear?\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, for 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 4's and 98 8's. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400-488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of 4's again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\nAnd 8's: units: 49, tens: 49. 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have missed something. Let me try another approach. Maybe list out the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, and the last group contributes 1 (484). So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: every 100 numbers, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing 1. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: same as 4's, 49.\n\n- Tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the occurrences of the digit 4 in each position separately: units, tens, and hundreds place. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the units place for 4: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place for 4: In every hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly ten times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens place has 4 appearing ten times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's there. Then from 410-419, tens digit is 1, no 4's. Similarly, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in the range 440-449. So that's ten more times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place for 8: Similar to 4, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8: In every hundred, the digit 8 appears ten times in the tens place, from 80-89. So, in each hundred, that's ten times. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see, the ranges are 401-488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8: The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49 (since 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens plus 8 extra, with 4 appearing once in units in the extra)\n- Tens: 50 (4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is ten more)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (48 full tens plus 488)\n- Tens: 49 (4 full hundreds *10=40, plus 480-488 is 9 more)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears ten times every 100 pages. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 occurrences, plus ten more in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 49 (48 from full sets and one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears ten times every 100 pages, totaling 40 from full hundreds, plus nine more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits. \n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I should count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The 4 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I should count each digit separately. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so there are 9 sets of 10 (10-19, 20-29, etc.), but actually, 10 to 99 is 90 numbers, so 90 divided by 10 is 9. So, 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm missing one? Let me think. No, because when I count the units place, each 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 10-99, that's 9 times, but actually, it's 9 times because 10-99 is 90 numbers, and 90/10=9. Wait, but 44 is included in that, so it's correct. So, 10 in the tens place and 9 in the units place, totaling 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me check again. From 10-99, the tens digit 4 occurs from 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. The units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So, 9 4's in the units place. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex. Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. \n\nFor the hundreds digit being 4: Pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, for the tens and units places in three-digit numbers. Let's handle the tens place first. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens and units places across all three-digit numbers from 100-488. \n\nLet me consider the tens place first. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nFor hundreds 100-399: There are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. \n\nNow, for the hundreds 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 404-413? Wait, no, 400-488. Let me think. The tens digit is 4 for 404-413? Wait, no, 404-409 is 6 numbers, but actually, the tens digit is 4 for 404-413? Wait, no, 404-413 is incorrect because 413 is beyond 488. Wait, 400-488: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, but wait, 449 is less than 488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place for 400-488. So, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers: 40 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 4's. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-399: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. From 400-488: The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 104,114,124,...,194). \n\nFor hundreds 100-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the units place, so 4 * 10 = 40. \n\nFor hundreds 400-488: The units digit is 4 for 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, how many is that? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 is the first, then every 10 numbers. From 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? It's 9 times because 484 is the last one. So, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The units digit cycles every 10, so 89 / 10 = 8 full cycles with 9 remaining. So, in each full cycle, the units digit 4 occurs once, so 8 times, and then in the remaining 9 numbers (480-488), the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, total 8 + 1 = 9 times. So, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488. \n\nTherefore, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 40 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 4's. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (50) + units place (49) = 89 + 50 = 139 + 49 = 188 4's. \n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) = 139, plus 49 (units) is 188. \n\nNow, let's total all 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (188) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 188 = 208 4's. \n\nHmm, that seems high. Let me check if I made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers. \n\nWait, when I counted the units place in three-digit numbers, I had 40 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 49. That seems correct. \n\nTens place: 40 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488, totaling 50. \n\nHundreds place: 89 from 400-488. \n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. \n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 188 = 208. \n\nOkay, now let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process. \n\nSingle-digit: 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 eight. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. \n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. \n\nUnits place: 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98). So, 9 eights in the units place. \n\nSo, total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights. \n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, no, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each. \n\nFrom 100-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. \n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 eights in the tens place. \n\nWait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for 400-488. \n\nSo, total tens place eights in three-digit numbers: 40 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49. \n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: For each hundred, the units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 100-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the units place, so 4 * 10 = 40. \n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit is 8 for 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total units place eights in three-digit numbers: 40 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49. \n\nTherefore, total eights in three-digit numbers: tens (49) + units (49) = 98. \n\nAdding single and two-digit eights: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nTotal eights: 20 + 98 = 118. \n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\nSingle-digit: 1. \n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nThree-digit: tens (40 + 9) = 49, units (40 + 9) = 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 98 = 118. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the total eights were 118, but let me confirm the three-digit counts. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, for the tens place: 40 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 49. \n\nUnits place: 40 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 49. \n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nTotal eights: 20 + 98 = 118. \n\nNow, the number of 4's was 208, and the number of 8's is 118. \n\nSo, the difference is 208 - 118 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems high. \n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the three-digit numbers, I had 89 in the hundreds place, 50 in the tens, and 49 in the units, totaling 188. Then adding single and two-digit 4's (20) gives 208. \n\nFor 8's, I had 0 in the hundreds, 49 in the tens, and 49 in the units, totaling 98. Adding single and two-digit 8's (20) gives 118. \n\n208 - 118 = 90. \n\nHmm, maybe that's correct, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me try another approach to verify. \n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit, considering all positions. \n\nFor 4's: \n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? \n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, check if the last partial block (480-488) has a 4 in the units place. 484 is within that, so that's an extra 1. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 49 in the units place for three-digit numbers, but in this approach, it's 49 total. Wait, no, this approach is considering all page numbers, including single and two-digit. Wait, but earlier I had 49 in three-digit units, plus 9 in two-digit units, plus 1 in single-digit, totaling 59. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests I might have made a mistake earlier. \n\nWait, let me clarify. \n\nIn the units place across all page numbers: \n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4). \n\n- Two-digit: 9 (14,24,...,94). \n\n- Three-digit: 49 (as calculated earlier). \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 49 = 59. \n\nSimilarly, in the tens place: \n\n- Single-digit: 0. \n\n- Two-digit: 10 (40-49). \n\n- Three-digit: 50 (as calculated earlier). \n\nTotal tens place 4's: 10 + 50 = 60. \n\nIn the hundreds place: \n\n- Single and two-digit: 0. \n\n- Three-digit: 89 (400-488). \n\nTotal hundreds place 4's: 89. \n\nSo, total 4's: 59 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 59 + 60 = 119 + 89 = 208. \n\nThat matches my earlier count. \n\nNow, for 8's: \n\nUnits place: \n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8). \n\n- Two-digit: 9 (18,28,...,98). \n\n- Three-digit: 49 (as calculated earlier). \n\nTotal units place 8's: 1 + 9 + 49 = 59. \n\nTens place: \n\n- Single-digit: 0. \n\n- Two-digit: 10 (80-89). \n\n- Three-digit: 49 (as calculated earlier). \n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 49 = 59. \n\nHundreds place: \n\n- 0, since hundreds digits go up to 4. \n\nTotal hundreds place 8's: 0. \n\nSo, total 8's: 59 (units) + 59 (tens) = 118. \n\nSo, 208 (4's) - 118 (8's) = 90. \n\nWait, so the difference is 90. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought about the units place for 4's, I got 49, but when I broke it down into single, two, and three-digit, it was 59. So, that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 208, and the number of 8's is 118. The difference is 208 - 118 = 90. \n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 208, and the digit 8 appears 118 times. The difference is 208 - 118 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits. \n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears only once, which is on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. So, for the tens place, the numbers 40-49 will have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 pages (40,41,...,49), so that's 10 4's. For the units place, every ten numbers (like 14,24,34,...,94) will have a 4 in the units digit. How many such numbers are there? From 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). So, 9 times, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten. So, 9 4's in the units place. So, total two-digit 4's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Let's break this down further. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 will only go up to 488, not 499. But for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, tens place: For the tens digit, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. Let's think about each hundred block. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 140-149, 240-249, etc. But since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred block (400-488) will have a partial set. \n\nSo, for 100-199: 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10 4's.\n\n300-399: 340-349, another 10 4's.\n\nNow, 400-488: The tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers again. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 4's in the tens place here as well. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 4's.\n\nNow, units place: Similarly, for the units digit, in each hundred block, the units digit cycles 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 exactly once every ten numbers. So, in each hundred block, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit 4 occurs in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, here, we need to check how many times 4 appears in the units place. The numbers would be 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers? Wait, no, from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let me think. It should be floor(89/10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. The first units digit 4 is at 404, which is the 5th number in 400-409. Then every 10 numbers after that. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's.\n\nWait, but wait, 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89+40+39=168 4's.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) is 168. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place for 400-488. Let me recount. From 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, right? Because 484 is the ninth occurrence, and the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9 times. So, 39 in units place.\n\nSo, total 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. So, total 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. Let's break it down into tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: For each ten-block (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the units digit 8 occurs once per block. There are 9 blocks (10-19 to 90-99), so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nTens place: Now, let's look at the tens digit. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10 eights.\n\n300-399: 380-389, 10 eights.\n\n400-488: Now, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nUnits place: Now, for the units digit, in each hundred block, the units digit 8 occurs once every ten numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 eights.\n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 eights.\n\n400-488: Now, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total units place eights: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nSo, total three-digit eights: tens place 39, units place 39, and hundreds place 0. So, 39 + 39 = 78 eights.\n\nWait, let me confirm that: tens place 39 and units place 39, so 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. So, total eights = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. Hmm.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). Wait, earlier I thought it was 9, but wait, from 10-99, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, right? So, 9 units place 4's in two-digit numbers. So, 10 + 9 = 19, which is correct.\n\nThree-digit 4's:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: 10 in each hundred block except the last one, which has 10 as well (440-449). Wait, earlier I thought 400-488 has 10 4's in the tens place, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, 10 in each of the four hundred blocks, so 10*4=40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred block, 10 4's except the last one, which has 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That's correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Plus single and two-digit: 1+19=20, so 20+168=188. Correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98). So, 10+9=19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 isn't in the book.\n\nTens place: 10 in each hundred block (180-189, etc.), except the last one, which has 9 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: 10 in each hundred block except the last one, which has 9 (408,418,...,488). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. Plus single and two-digit: 1+19=20, so 20+78=98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference: 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers, especially the units place for 4's and 8's. Did I count correctly?\n\nFor 4's in units place in 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nFor 8's in units place in 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, yes, that seems accurate.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, for the units digit in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4's: in 100-999, each units digit appears 100 times per hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred is truncated.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. My initial count seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n   - Units place: 9 occurrences (14,24,...,94).\n   - Total: 19.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - Tens place: 40 occurrences (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Units place: 39 occurrences (104,114,...,484).\n   - Total: 168.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n   - Units place: 9 occurrences (18,28,...,98).\n   - Total: 19.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\n   - Tens place: 39 occurrences (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Units place: 39 occurrences (108,118,...,488).\n   - Total: 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down by the number of digits. For single-digit page numbers, the only page with a 4 is page 4. So that's one 4. For two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99, I can think of each page number as having a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. In the tens place, 4 can appear from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. In the units place, 4 can appear in every set of ten pages, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here, so each occurrence is one 4. From 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's once every ten numbers, so 9 times (since 44 is included). Wait, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). Each decade has one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so does 44 get counted twice? Hmm, yes, because 44 has a 4 in both the tens and units place. So when I count the tens place, I include 44, and when I count the units place, I include 44 as well. So the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19? Wait, no, because from 10 to 99, the units place 4 occurs 9 times (14,24,...,94), which is 9 times. So 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units, so that's correct because it has two 4's. So for two-digit numbers, 19 4's. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down further. Each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place. Let's start with the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, 4 can appear from 400 to 488. So that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, the tens place. In the tens place, 4 can appear in any hundred, but only in the tens digit. So for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 100-199: 140-149, so 10 times. From 200-299: 240-249, 10 times. From 300-399: 340-349, 10 times. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. So that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40 times. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 40. Now, the units place. In the units place, 4 can appear in every ten numbers, regardless of the hundreds and tens digits. So for each hundred, from 00-99, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place per hundred. So from 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times. 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times. 400-488: Now, here, the units place 4's would be 404,414,...,484. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 400-488? Let's see: starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 404 to 484 is every 10 numbers, so 9 times (since 404 + 10*9 = 494, but 494 is beyond 488, so actually, it's 9 times: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484). Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers. So how many full decades are there? From 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So 400-409: 404, 410-419:414, etc. So from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let's calculate: 400 + 4 = 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So 9 times. Therefore, the units place in three-digit numbers: 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 3*10=30, plus 9 from 400-488, so total 39. So units place in three-digit numbers: 39. So total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168. Wait, but let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Tens place: in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 10 pages each. So 4 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so does the tens place in 400-488 have 10 4's? Wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So yes, 10 times. So 4 sets (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. So that's correct. Units place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So 10+10+10+9=39. So total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89+40+39=168. Now, adding up all the 4's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. So total 4's: 1+19=20+168=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach. Single-digit page numbers: page 8. So that's one 8. Two-digit page numbers: from 10-99. Tens place: 80-89, which is 10 pages, so 10 8's. Units place: in each decade (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the units digit is 8 once, so 9 times (18,28,...,98). But wait, 88 is in 80-89, which is already counted in the tens place, but in the units place, 88 would be counted again. So similar to the 4's, the units place 8's are 9 times (18,28,...,98). So total two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. Now, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Let's count the 8's in each place. Hundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place: 0. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 10 pages. So from 100-199: 180-189, 10 pages. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 pages. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 pages. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, 400-488 contributes 9 8's (480-488). So total tens place 8's: 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 3*10=30, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. Units place: in each hundred, the units digit is 8 once per ten pages. So from 100-199: 108,118,...,198:10 times. From 200-299: 208,218,...,298:10 times. From 300-399: 308,318,...,398:10 times. From 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included. So units place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39. So total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39=78. Now, adding up all the 8's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So total 8's:1+19=20+78=98. Wait, that can't be right because 1+19=20, and 20+78=98. Hmm, but let me check again. Single-digit:1. Two-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. Three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39, so 78. So total 8's:1+19+78=98. Now, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98. So the difference is 188-98=90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10, units place 14,24,...,94:9. Total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89.\n\nTens place:100-199:140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, 400-488:440-449:10. Total 40.\n\nUnits place:100-199:104,114,...,194:10, 200-299:204,...,294:10, 300-399:304,...,394:10, 400-488:404,...,484:9. Total 39.\n\nSo 89+40+39=168 in three-digit. Plus 1+19=20. Total 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89:10, units place 18,28,...,98:9. Total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, 400-488:480-488:9. Total 39.\n\nUnits place:100-199:108,...,198:10, 200-299:208,...,298:10, 300-399:308,...,398:10, 400-488:408,418,...,488:9. Total 39.\n\nSo 39+39=78 in three-digit. Plus 1+19=20. Total 98. So 188-98=90. So yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
