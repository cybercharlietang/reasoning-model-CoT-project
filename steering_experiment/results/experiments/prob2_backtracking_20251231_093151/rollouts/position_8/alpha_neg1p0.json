    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9), the digit 4 appears only once, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. For the tens place, the number would be 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Next, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, that's 9 numbers. But wait, page 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I've already counted one 4 in the tens place and another in the units place? Hmm, so maybe I should count each occurrence separately. So, in the units place, from 10 to 99, every ten numbers will have one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times (since 44 is included). Wait, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, for each ten numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-19, 20-29,...90-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, 44 is in the 40-49 range, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, in the units place, from 10-99, the 4's in the units place would be 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so actually, it's 9 digits, but in terms of counts, each occurrence is separate. So, that's 9 4's in the units place for two-digit numbers. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's. Then, in the units place, from 10-99, every ten numbers has one 4 in the units place, so 9 times (since 10-19 has 14, 20-29 has 24, etc., up to 90-99 has 94). So, that's 9 4's in the units place. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited up to 88.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. Pages from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 4 in any hundred, so we have 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). However, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 4, but the units digit can only go up to 8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit being 4 would cover pages 440-449, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is fully included, right? Wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's fine. So, for each hundred except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 contributes 10 pages. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 pages, so 3*10 = 30 4's in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 contributes 10 pages (440-449), so that's another 10. So, total 30 + 10 = 40 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check that. For 100-199, the tens digit 4 would be 140-149, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's four sets of 10 pages each, so 4*10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 only goes up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so yes, that's 10 pages. So, total 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit can be 4 in any position, so for each hundred, in each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. Let's see. For 100-199, in each ten (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. So, for 100-199, that's 10, 200-299 another 10, 300-399 another 10, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so how many times does the units digit 4 occur? It occurs once every ten numbers, so from 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each ten, the units digit 4 occurs once, so that's 9 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a units digit of 8, so the units digit 4 in 480-488 would be at 484. So, that's one occurrence. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times (404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484). Wait, that's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So, yes, 39 in total.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers would be:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nHmm, wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, 140-149, 240-249, etc., each contributes 10 4's, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is only part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is only up to 440-449, which is 10 pages, right? So, that's 10 4's in the tens place for 400-488. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 3*10=30. Then, 400-488 contributes another 10, so 30+10=40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: in each hundred, 100-199 has 10 4's in the units place, same for 200-299 and 300-399. Then, 400-488 has 9 4's in the units place, as we saw. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit numbers. Then, adding single-digit and two-digit: 1+19=20, so total 4's: 20+168=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99): The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. However, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, we have 9 8's, but 88 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place. So, in the units place, it's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages (100-488). Again, considering hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the 400-488 range. So, let's see:\n\nFor each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 pages.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 pages.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 pages.\n- 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 occurs in:\n\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in every ten numbers. So, for each hundred, in each ten, there's one 8 in the units place. Let's break it down:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so from 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place 8's:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal units place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nSo, 39+39=78.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89: 10, units place 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 9, so 10+9=19. That's correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9, so 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1+19=20, plus 78=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 188 seems high. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 4's.\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 4's.\nTotal: 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 4's.\n- Tens place: 140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 10 each, so 4*10=40. Wait, no, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 only contributes 10, but actually, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10, and the other three hundreds each contribute 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 4's (104,114,...,194).\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9 (404,414,...,484).\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the units place, I might have missed something. Let me check the units place for 4's again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, units digit 4:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299:204,214,...,294:10\n- 300-399:304,...,394:10\n- 400-488:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484:9 numbers.\n\nYes, that's 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units digit:\n\n- 100-199:108,118,...,198:10\n- 200-299:208,...,298:10\n- 300-399:308,...,398:10\n- 400-488:408,418,...,488:9.\n\nYes, that's 39.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. In the three-digit numbers, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. But 488 is included, so 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, which we've counted. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds digit never appears as 8 because the book ends at 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4 has a 4. So, 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49: 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 104, 114, ..., 194; 204, ..., 294; 304, ..., 394; 404, ..., 484: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89: 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 108, 118, ..., 198; 208, ..., 298; 308, ..., 398; 408, ..., 488: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9, only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. Let me consider the tens place first. The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, and for each tens digit, the ones digit can be 0-9. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences. \n\nNext, for the ones place in two-digit numbers: the ones digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one page where the ones digit is 4. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 occurrences.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 10-99, the tens digits go from 1 to 9, so 9 sets, each contributing one 4 in the ones place. So, 9 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nSo, so far, for single and two-digit numbers, we have 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. These are a bit more complex because each page number has three digits. Let me break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488.\n\nLet's count the 4's in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nSo, for hundreds 1, 2, 3: each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. That's 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 pages. So, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers are 30 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers: similar to the tens place, for each hundred, the ones digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the ones digit is 4 for 10 pages. \n\nSo, for hundreds 1, 2, 3: each contributes 10 occurrences, so 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the ones digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the ones digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, how many times does the ones digit 4 occur? Let's see: starting at 404, then every 10 pages, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers are 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from hundreds 4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10, but for hundreds 4, it's only 9. So, total ones place 4's are 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since 488 is the last page, the last ten is 480-488, so the ones digits go up to 8. So, in 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484, which is 9 times, as I thought. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + ones place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (ones) is 168. Hmm, but let me think again. From 100-488, the hundreds digit 4 occurs 89 times, yes. For tens and ones digits, in each of the hundreds 1-4, except that for hundreds 4, the ones digit 4 occurs only 9 times, as we saw.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor the hundreds place: 4 occurs from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nFor the tens place: in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in each hundred except the last one, which only goes up to 488. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, actually, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place, including the last hundred. So, 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, which matches what I had before.\n\nSimilarly, for the ones place: in each hundred, the ones digit 4 occurs 10 times, except for the last hundred (400-488), where it occurs 9 times because the last page is 488. So, 3 hundreds contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, so 3*10 + 9=39, which matches.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Let's say from 100-199: hundreds digit 1, so 0 4's in hundreds place. Tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149: 10 pages. Ones digit 4 occurs in 104,114,124,...,194: 10 times. So, 0 +10 +10=20 4's in 100-199. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 400-488: hundreds digit 4 occurs 89 times. Tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). Ones digit 4 occurs 9 times (404,414,...,484). So, 89+10+9=108. Wait, but earlier I had 89+40+39=168, which would include all three hundreds. Wait, no, the 89 is just from hundreds place in 400-488, and the 40 and 39 are from tens and ones across all hundreds. Wait, maybe I confused the breakdown.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds place 4's are only in 400-488, which is 89. The tens place 4's are across all hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Similarly, the ones place 4's are across all hundreds except the last, which contributes 9. So, 3*10 +9=39. So, total 4's are 89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me check 100-199: 20 4's, as I saw earlier. Similarly, 200-299: same, 20 4's. 300-399: 20 4's. 400-488: let's see, hundreds digit 4: 89. Tens digit 4: 10. Ones digit 4:9. So, 89+10+9=108. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) +20 (300-399) +108 (400-488) = 20+20+20+108=168. That matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20 +168=188.\n\nWait, 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1-9, only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10-99. Let's count the 8's in tens and ones places.\n\nTens place: the tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89. That's 10 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nOnes place: for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the ones digit is 8 once. There are 9 sets of ten (10-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (ones) =19.\n\nSo, so far, single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) =20 occurrences of 8.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nLet's break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers because the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nSo, for hundreds 1,2,3: each contributes 10 occurrences, so 3*10=30.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit cycles up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). But wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but wait: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 occurrences in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 3*10 (from hundreds 1-3) +9 (from hundreds 4) =30+9=39.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers: similar approach. For each hundred, the ones digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the ones digit is 8 for 10 pages.\n\nSo, for hundreds 1,2,3: each contributes 10 occurrences, so 3*10=30.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the ones digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is the last page, so the last one is 488.\n\nSo, total ones place 8's in three-digit numbers: 3*10 +9=30+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + ones place (39) =78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Wait, no, the hundreds place contributes 0, the tens place contributes 39, and the ones place contributes 39. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0+39+39=78.\n\nWait, but let me verify with a smaller example. From 100-199: tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189: 10 pages. Ones digit 8 occurs in 108,118,...,198: 10 pages. So, 10+10=20 8's in 100-199. Similarly, 200-299: same, 20 8's. 300-399: same, 20 8's. 400-488: tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488:9 pages. Ones digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488:9 pages. So, 9+9=18 8's in 400-488.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 20 (100-199) +20 (200-299)+20 (300-399)+18 (400-488)=20+20+20+18=78. That matches.\n\nSo, total 8's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20 +78=98.\n\nWait, 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal:1+19+168=188\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me just go through each step again to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: only page 4, so 1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- Ones place: for each ten (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), one 4 in the ones place:9 occurrences.\nTotal:10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: in each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, except the last hundred which has 10 as well because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, 4*10=40.\n- Ones place: in each of the first three hundreds (100-199,200-299,300-399), the ones digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, it occurs 9 times (404,414,...,484). So, 30+9=39.\nTotal in three-digit:89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: only page 8, so 1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10 pages, so 10 8's.\n- Ones place: for each ten (10-19,...,90-99), one 8 in the ones place:9 occurrences.\nTotal:10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place:0, since hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4.\n- Tens place: in each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times each except the last hundred, which has 9 occurrences (480-488). So, 3*10 +9=39.\n- Ones place: in each of the first three hundreds, the ones digit 8 occurs 10 times each:3*10=30. In 400-488, it occurs 9 times (408,418,...,488). So, 30+9=39.\nTotal in three-digit:0+39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4 has a 4.\n   - Total: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages.\n   - **Ones place:** For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), there's one page with a 4 in the ones place. There are 9 such sets.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages.\n   - **Tens place:** For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages each. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - **Ones place:** For each of the first three hundreds, the ones digit is 4 for 10 pages each. For 400-488, it's 9 pages. Total: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8 has an 8.\n   - Total: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 pages.\n   - **Ones place:** For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), there's one page with an 8 in the ones place. There are 9 such sets.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's since hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n   - **Tens place:** For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages each except the last hundred, which has 9 pages (480-488). Total: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Ones place:** For each of the first three hundreds, the ones digit is 8 for 10 pages each. For 400-488, it's 9 pages. Total: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me consider each place separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, ..., 49), so 10 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nFor the units place: In the two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times. In each cycle, 4 appears once. So, that's 10 occurrences (like 14, 24, 34, ..., 94).\n\nAdding these together for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 10 (units place) = 20 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited because 488 is the maximum. Let me handle this carefully.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to split the three-digit numbers into two parts: from 100 to 399, and from 400 to 488. That might make it easier.\n\nFrom 100 to 399: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, in this range, the hundreds place doesn't have any 4's. So, I don't need to count 4's in the hundreds place here. Now, for the tens and units places in this range, I can calculate how many times 4 appears.\n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. Since there are three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every ten numbers. So, for each hundred, in each ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 tens in each hundred, so that's 10 occurrences per hundred. Again, three hundreds, so 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nSo, from 100 to 399, the digit 4 appears 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60 times.\n\nNow, from 400 to 488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's count how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in 400-488. The tens digit can range from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the upper limit). So, for each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0 to 9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8.\n\nWait, actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. But when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, not 9. So, let me break it down.\n\nFor tens digits from 0 to 7: Each of these has 10 numbers (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), so the digit 4 in the tens place would occur when the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, I'm considering the tens place in 400-488. So, the tens digit is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for how many times 4 appears in the tens place. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only once, specifically from 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but that's only if the tens digit is 4. So, in the range 400-488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in 400-488: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each ten numbers. So, for each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. But we have to consider that when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, so in that case, the units digit 4 would still be present as 484, but 488 is the last number, so 484 is included.\n\nWait, let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 400 to 488. Each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each ten numbers, 4 appears once. So, how many tens are there?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, so that's 9 complete tens (0-8) but the last one is incomplete. Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, it's 89 numbers. Let me think differently.\n\nEach hundred has 100 numbers, but we're only going up to 488, so from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? In each ten numbers, it appears once. So, in 89 numbers, how many complete tens are there? 8 complete tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each of 10 numbers) and 9 extra numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in each of the 8 full tens, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 8 times. In the last partial ten, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once as 484. So, total units digit 4's in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, 4 appears once in the units place. How many full tens are there? From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8. So, for tens digits 0 to 7, each has 10 numbers, and for tens digit 8, it has 9 numbers. So, in tens digits 0 to 7, each has 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 8 occurrences. In tens digit 8, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another occurrence. So, total 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, in the three-digit numbers from 400-488, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (since every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place)\n- Tens place: 10 times (from 440-449)\n- Units place: 9 times\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers (400-488): 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, from 100-399, we had 60 occurrences of 4's, and from 400-488, we have 108. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 60 + 108 = 168.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because from 100-399, it's 60, and from 400-488, it's 108, so total 60 + 108 = 168. But let me check if I added correctly.\n\nWait, actually, from 100-399: 60 4's.\n\nFrom 400-488: 108 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 60 + 108 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count. No, because 100-399 and 400-488 are separate ranges, so adding them is correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number with an 8 is page 8, so that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have an 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: In each ten numbers (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten (10-99), so 9 occurrences. Wait, no, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens (10-19 up to 90-99). So, in each ten, the units digit 8 appears once, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 9 tens (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each of these, the units digit 8 appears once, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's split this into 100-399 and 400-488.\n\nFrom 100-399: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198 in 100-199). So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nSo, from 100-399, the digit 8 appears 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60 times.\n\nNow, from 400-488: Let's check how many times 8 appears in each place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's here.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 0 to 8. So, the numbers where the tens digit is 8 are from 480 to 488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: The units digit 8 appears in numbers where the last digit is 8. So, in each ten numbers, it appears once. Let's see how many times that happens from 400 to 488.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, and 488. That's 9 occurrences because from 400 to 488, each ten has one 8, but when we reach 488, that's included. Wait, but let me count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in 400-488, the digit 8 appears:\n\n- Tens place: 9 times\n- Units place: 9 times\n\nTotal 8's in 400-488: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any. For the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times. For the units place, from 400-488, every ten has an 8 in the units place, so 408, 418, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 18 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: from 100-399: 60, from 400-488: 18. So, total 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 20\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 20 + 168 = 189.\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought three-digit 4's were 168, which included both 100-399 and 400-488. So, 60 + 108 = 168, yes. So, total 4's: 1 + 20 + 168 = 189.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 189, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49) and units place 10 (14,24,...94) \u2192 20\nThree-digit:\n- 100-399: tens place 30 (each hundred contributes 10), units place 30 \u2192 60\n- 400-488: hundreds place 89, tens place 10 (440-449), units place 9 (408,418,...488) \u2192 89 +10 +9=108\nTotal three-digit 4's: 60 +108=168\nTotal 4's: 1 +20 +168=189\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...98) \u219219\nThree-digit:\n- 100-399: tens place 30, units place 30 \u219260\n- 400-488: tens place 9 (480-488), units place 9 (408,418,...488) \u219218\nTotal three-digit 8's:60 +18=78\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nDifference:189 -98=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 189, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4,14,24,... up to 484. Now, I need to find out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within this range. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. How many times does 4 appear in the tens digit? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, and so on. So, let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many full hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is another 10. However, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. So that's 2 sets of 10, which is 20 numbers. But wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 20. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does 440-449 fit within that? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10 numbers), so that's 20. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 20 = 60? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so maybe I'm overcounting. Wait, let me think again. \n\nActually, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so in 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. So, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, which is 20 numbers. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 (from 0-399) plus 20 (from 400-488), totaling 60. Wait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 20 is 60. But wait, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, so I think that's correct. So, 60 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units place 49, tens place 60, hundreds place 89. So total 4's: 49 + 60 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 60 is 109, plus 89 is 198. So, 198 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Again, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? Similar to the 4's, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn each full hundred, that's 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 198, total 8's: 98. The difference is 198 - 98 = 100.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10 numbers). Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 20. So, 40 + 20 = 60.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 60 + 89 = 198. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, +9. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 198 - 98 = 100.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 100 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and one additional '4' in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 '4's. Four full hundreds (1-399) give 40. The range 400-488 adds 20 more '4's, totaling 60.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 198.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '8'. There are 48 full decades and one additional '8' in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 '8's. Four full hundreds give 40. The range 400-488 adds 9 more '8's, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no '8's in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 198 - 98 = 100.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{100}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I can think of this as having a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers ending with 4 in the units place are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that count as two? Hmm, no, I think each occurrence of the digit is counted separately, so 44 would contribute two 4's. But wait, when I'm counting the tens place, I already counted the 4 in 44's tens place, and now I'm counting the units place, so I should include it here as well. So, 44 contributes one more 4 in the units place. So, actually, for the units place, from 10 to 99, the numbers ending with 4 are 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so that's 9 digits in the units place, but 44 adds an extra 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Each digit is counted separately, so in the units place, every time the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit, it's one occurrence. So, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So that's 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has 4 in both tens and units, so in the units place, it's still just one occurrence. So, 9 times in the units place, and 10 times in the tens place, so total for two-digit numbers, 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. Again, I'll break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but not beyond. So, let's see:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100 to 199. How many 4's in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200 to 299. Similarly, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300 to 399. Again, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400 to 488. Now, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, so for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149. So, 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, the tens digit is 4 for 20 numbers: 240-249. So, another 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Again, tens digit 4 for 30 numbers: 340-349. Another 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, the tens digit is 4 for 40 numbers: 440-449. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within the range, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundreds group, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Units digit 4 occurs in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 204,214,...,294. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 304,314,...,394. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, let's count: from 400 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for units place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place: 89.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred (1,2,3,4), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds 1,2,3, each contribute 10, so 30, and for hundreds 4, it's 9, so total 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, plus 168 (three-digit) = 188 total 4's. Hmm, let me see if that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 8 is one of them, so that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Again, tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers ending with 8 from 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. But 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, it's still just one occurrence, but in the tens place, it's already counted. So, units place: 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: From 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would only occur if the hundreds digit is 8, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred group, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Tens digit 8: 180-189. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Tens digit 8: 280-289. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Tens digit 8: 380-389. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Tens digit 8: 480-488. Wait, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Units digit 8: 208,218,...,298. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Units digit 8: 308,318,...,398. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Units digit 8: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for units place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have miscounted.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: tens place 10, units place 9 \u2192 19\n\n- Three-digit: hundreds 89, tens 40, units 39 \u2192 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: tens 10, units 9 \u2192 19\n\n- Three-digit: tens 39, units 39 \u2192 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for units place, when hundreds digit is 4, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10, so 30, plus 9 for hundreds digit 4, totaling 39. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit units place: hundreds digits 1,2,3 each contribute 10, so 30, plus 9 for hundreds digit 4, totaling 39. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in ranges, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach, maybe using a formula or a more systematic way.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8, it's the same.\n\nBut for the entire range, we can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial group.\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, which is not a multiple of 10, we have to adjust.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nfloor(n / 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, it's:\n\nfloor(n / 100) * 10 + (min(max(n % 100 - 10 * d + 1, 0), 10) if d > 0 else n % 100 + 1)\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's think about each digit position.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, total blocks = 488 // 10 = 48 blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check the remainder: 488 % 10 = 8. Since 4 <= 8, we add 1 more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 188, which seems conflicting. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, because earlier I was counting 4's in all digit positions, not just units. So, perhaps this approach is better.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the total number of 4's and 8's printed, regardless of position. So, perhaps using this method for each digit position would be more accurate.\n\nLet me try this approach for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488:\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 // 10 = 48. Each contributes 1 occurrence, so 48.\n\nRemainder: 488 % 10 = 8. Since 4 <= 8, add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in the tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 488 // 100 = 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nRemainder: 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nIn the remainder, the tens digit is 88, so the tens digit is 8 in the last partial hundred. The digit 4 in the tens place would occur in the range 40-49 in the tens place, but since the remainder is 88, which is more than 49, we have another 10 occurrences? Wait, no, because the remainder is 88, which is within the same hundred. So, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, we add 10.\n\nWait, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in the hundreds place:\n\nThis occurs from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nSame as before. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, for digit 8:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488:\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 // 10 = 48. Each contributes 1, so 48.\n\nRemainder: 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 <= 8, add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 488 // 100 = 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nRemainder: 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, add 9.\n\nTotal tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the hundreds place:\n\nThis would be from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check another way. Maybe by writing out the counts for smaller ranges and see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, in a 10-page book, how many 4's and 8's?\n\nPages 1-10:\n\n4's: page 4 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n\n8's: page 8 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nBut according to the formula, units place for 4: 10//10=1, remainder 0, so 1. Tens place: 10//100=0, remainder 10, so 0 + (if 4 <= 10's digit? No, 10's digit is 1, so 0). So, total 4's: 1. Similarly, 8's: units place 1, tens place 0. So, difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 20-page book.\n\n4's: units place: 20//10=2, remainder 0, so 2. Tens place: 20//100=0, remainder 20, so 0 + (if 4 <= 2? No, so 0). So, total 4's: 2.\n\n8's: units place: 20//10=2, remainder 0, so 2. Tens place: 20//100=0, remainder 20, so 0 + (if 8 <=2? No, so 0). So, total 8's: 2. Difference: 0.\n\nWait, but in reality, pages 4,8,14,18: 4's are 4,14 \u2192 2, 8's are 8,18 \u2192 2. So, difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 50-page book.\n\n4's: units place: 50//10=5, remainder 0, so 5. Tens place: 50//100=0, remainder 50. The tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 50, it's 10. So, total 4's: 5 + 10 = 15.\n\n8's: units place: 50//10=5, remainder 0, so 5. Tens place: 50//100=0, remainder 50. The tens digit 8 occurs in 40-49? No, wait, 80-89 is beyond 50, so in the tens place, 8 doesn't occur in 1-50. So, tens place: 0. So, total 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10.\n\nWait, let's count manually:\n\n4's: pages 4,14,24,34,44, and in the tens place: 40-49, which is 10 pages, but each has a 4 in the tens place. Wait, but in the units place, 44 has already been counted. So, total 4's: units place: 5 (4,14,24,34,44) and tens place: 10 (40-49). But wait, 44 is counted twice: once in units and once in tens. So, total 5 + 10 = 15, but 44 is counted twice, so actual unique pages with 4's are 15, but the digit count is 15 (since each occurrence is counted separately). Similarly, 8's: units place: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5 occurrences. Tens place: none, since 80-89 is beyond 50. So, total 8's: 5. So, difference is 10. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, applying this to 488 pages, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once in page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's break it down:\n\n- Tens place: The numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- Units place: For each ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together, two-digit numbers contribute 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places to consider.\n\nLet's break it down by each digit place:\n\n1. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, looking at the tens digit across all three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digits go from 0 to 9, but for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). \n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0 to 8, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but hold on, the last page is 488, so when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit goes up to 8. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, total tens place occurrences of 4 are 30 + 10 = 40.\n\n3. Units place: Similarly, for the units digit, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. \n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400 to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488, and 494 would be beyond 488. Wait, let me count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together, the units place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10, but for the last hundred (400-488), it's only 9. So, total units place is 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the three-digit contributions:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit contributions:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Yes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The digit 8 appears once in page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\n- Tens place: The numbers 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- Units place: For each ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together, two-digit numbers contribute 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of the digit 8.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Again, breaking it down by each digit place.\n\n1. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits are only 1, 2, 3, 4. So, 0 occurrences.\n\n2. Tens place: Looking at the tens digit across all three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Let's see: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place occurrences of 8 are 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. Units place: For the units digit, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 8.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400 to 488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units place contributions: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the three-digit contributions:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal three-digit 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit contributions:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that. 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. Yes.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98.\n\nSubtracting: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4)\n- **Two-digit (10-99):** 10 (tens place: 40-49) + 9 (units place: x4 in each ten) = 19\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences\n  - Tens place: 4x0-4x9 for x=1,2,3 \u2192 30; 440-449 \u2192 10 \u2192 Total 40\n  - Units place: x4y for x=1,2,3 and y=0-9 \u2192 30; 404,414,...,484 \u2192 9 \u2192 Total 39\n  - Total three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8)\n- **Two-digit (10-99):** 10 (tens place: 80-89) + 9 (units place: x8 in each ten) = 19\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences\n  - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 30; 480-488 \u2192 9 \u2192 Total 39\n  - Units place: x8y for x=1,2,3 and y=0-9 \u2192 30; 408,418,...,488 \u2192 9 \u2192 Total 39\n  - Total three-digit 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n- **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I should count the number of 4's in both places.\n\nFirst, the tens place: the numbers 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. Next, the units place: in the range 10-99, the 4 appears once every ten numbers, specifically at 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm double-counting? Hmm, no, because I'm counting each digit separately. So, each 4 in the units place is counted once, regardless of whether there's another 4 in the tens place. So, 9 more 4's in the units place. So, for two-digit numbers, I have 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down by each digit place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears only in the numbers 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, adding these up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, yes, 40 in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens group. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nFrom 100-199: 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294. Another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394. Another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because it doesn't go up to 499. So, let's see. The units digit cycles every 10, so starting from 400, the units digits go 0-9, then 0-9, etc., up to 488. So, how many full tens are there? From 400-480, that's 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear?\n\nEach ten has one 4 in the units place. So, from 400-480, that's 9 tens (400-409 is the first ten, 410-419 is the second, ..., 480-489 is the ninth). But since we're only going up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). But the units digit 4 in this range would be at 484. So, in the 480-488 range, only one occurrence of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? It would be at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences because 404 is the first, then every 10 pages after that until 484, which is within 488. So, 9 times in the units place for the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, adding up the units place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred had 10, so 3 hundreds would be 30, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, totaling 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39. Let me add that up: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit 8 is page 8, so that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit numbers: 10-99. Again, we'll look at tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers where the tens digit is 8, which are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: In the range 10-99, the units digit is 8 in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Note that 88 has two 8's, but we're counting each occurrence separately, so that's fine.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, looking at the tens digit in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 8. So, let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the range, but our book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Now, looking at the units digit in three-digit numbers. The units digit is 8 once every ten numbers. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place from 100-488.\n\nFrom 100-199: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208, 218, 228, 238, 248, 258, 268, 278, 288, 298. Another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 308, 318, 328, 338, 348, 358, 368, 378, 388, 398. Another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, similar to before, let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. Starting from 400, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 408 is the first, then every 10 until 488, which is included. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, that's the same as the tens place, which seems correct.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only page with a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99): Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me separate these.\n\nFirst, the tens place: Pages 40-49. That's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), there's one page where the units digit is 4. So, that's 9 occurrences (since 10-99 is 9 decades). Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades, but each decade has one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times 1, which is 9 occurrences. But wait, page 44 would have been counted twice, once in the tens place and once in the units place. But in this case, we're just counting each place separately, so it's okay. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but from 10-99, the units digits go from 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. Since there are 9 tens (10-99), that's 9 times 1, so 9. Plus the 10 pages where the tens digit is 4, making it 19. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units digits. Let me break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: Pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many 4's are in the hundreds place? Only pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449). But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 occurrences. So, total in tens place: 30 (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488) =40.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 100-199: 140-149 is 10 pages. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, each 10 pages. So, 3 hundreds, 10 each, that's 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 40 total.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences (e.g., 104,114,...,194 in 100-199). So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 occurrences, so 3*10=30. Now, for 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, how many full tens are there? From 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8 in 488. So, for each ten (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488), the units digit 4 appears once per ten. Now, how many full tens are there? From 400-480, that's 9 tens (400-409, ...,480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages). So, in each of these 9 tens, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so the tens are 400-409 (10 pages), 410-419 (10), ..., 480-488 (9 pages). So, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? For each ten, once, so for 9 tens (400-409 up to 480-488), that's 9 times. So, units digit 4 in 400-488 is 9. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 units digit 4's, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once per ten, and there are 9 tens (since 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 9 full tens of 10 pages each, but the last ten is only 9 pages). So, in each ten, units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. So, total units digit 4's: 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89+40=129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) =1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only page with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99): Again, tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Pages 80-89. That's 10 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ...,90-99), there's one page where the units digit is 8. So, that's 9 occurrences (since 10-99 is 9 decades). So, 9.\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 +9=19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages each. So, for 100-199: 180-189, 10 pages. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, each 10 pages. So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place for 400-488, 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's: 30 +9=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit is 8 once per ten. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 occurrences of 8 in the units place (e.g., 108,118,...,198 in 100-199). So, 3*10=30. Now, for 400-488, the units digit is 8 once per ten. How many tens are there? From 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. So, that's 9 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units digit 8's in 400-488:9. So, total units digit 8's:30 +9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39=78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78)=1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (4 in each ten from 10-99 except 40-49, which is already counted). Wait, no, in the two-digit numbers, units digit 4's are 9, because from 10-99, each ten has one 4 in the units place, except that 40-49 is already counted in the tens place. So, actually, in two-digit numbers, units digit 4's are 9 (10-99), so 10+9=19. That's correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399), 10 each, so 30. Then 400-488, tens digit 8 is 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10. So, 30+10=40.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, 10 each, so 30. Then, 400-488, units digit 4 appears once per ten, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 408,418,...,488, which is 9 pages). So, 30+9=39.\n\nTotal 4's:89+40+39=168. Wait, but earlier I thought 89+40=129, 129+39=168, but then I added single and two-digit to get 188. Wait, yes, because single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168, total 1+19=20, 20+168=188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (8 in each ten from 10-99 except 80-89, so 9). So, 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:0, since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399), 10 each, so 30. Then, in 400-488, tens digit 8 is 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 9. So, 30+9=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, 10 each, so 30. Then, in 400-488, units digit 8 appears 9 times (408,418,...,488). So, 30+9=39.\n\nTotal 8's:39+39=78. Plus single and two-digit:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit 8's again. In the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences. So, 30 (from 100-399) +9=39.\n\nUnits place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 units digit 8's, so 30. Then, 400-488, units digit 8 appears 9 times (408,418,...,488). So, 30+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit:39+39=78. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: One '4' per ten (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94) \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 10 \u2192 30 + 10 = 40.\n     - Units place: Each hundred contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: One '8' per ten (e.g., 18, 28, ..., 98) \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: '8' doesn't appear \u2192 0.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Units place: Each hundred contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. For the tens place, the 4 can be in positions 40-49. That's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. For the ones place, the 4 appears once in each set of ten, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10-99, that's 9 occurrences, right? Because 44 has two 4's, but I think I should count each occurrence separately. So, in the ones place, there are 9 pages where the digit 4 appears. So, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19. \n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers (100-488). This is a bit more complex. Let's break it down by each digit position: hundreds, tens, and ones. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 5 or higher. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each hundred, the 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). But since we're only going up to 488, we need to check how many complete sets of 100 we have and if the last hundred is complete or not. \n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4, so that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, from 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total for the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so 440-449 is within that range, so that's 10 pages. So, yes, 40 in total. \n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in each ten, so 10 times per hundred. From 100-399: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30. From 400-488: The ones digit cycles 0-8 (since 488 is the last page), so 4 appears once in each ten, but we need to check how many times it appears. From 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-8, so 4 appears once every ten, so 9 times (since 488 is the last, so the ones digit goes up to 8). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. So, the ones digit goes from 0 to 8 in each ten. So, for each ten (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the ones digit 4 appears once. There are 9 tens (400-409 is the first, up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last ten is 480-488). So, in each ten, the ones digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. Therefore, from 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears 9 times. So, total for the ones place in three-digit numbers is 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nWait, but let me check that. From 100-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences in the ones place, so 3\u00d710=30. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? The ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since we stop at 488, the last ten is 480-488, so the ones digits go up to 8. So, in each ten, 4 appears once. How many tens are there from 400-488? Let's see: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 tens (since 400-409 is the first, up to 480-488). So, 9 tens, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, so 9\u00d71=9. So, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30+9=39. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (89+40+39). Wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I broke down the hundreds, tens, and ones places separately. So, hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, ones place: 39. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers is 89+40+39=168. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168. \n\nThen, adding the two-digit and single-digit: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a more systematic approach. \n\nAnother way is to consider each digit position separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\nLet's start with the units place (ones digit). For every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, which is 480 numbers, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total units place 4's: 48. \n\nNext, the tens place. For every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. \n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's: 89. \n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Wait, that's different from my earlier count of 188. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check where. \n\nWait, in the units place, I calculated 48, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48\u00d71=48. Then, the last partial cycle is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, none of which have 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48. \n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. \n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. \n\nSo, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 188, but now it's 187. Hmm, perhaps I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the three-digit numbers again. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, I had broken it down as hundreds, tens, and ones. \n\nWait, perhaps in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets and then one more set in 400-488, making 50. So, that's correct. \n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, it's 48 times. \n\nSo, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 188, so I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me see. \n\nWait, in the initial approach, I considered single-digit as 1, two-digit as 19, and three-digit as 168, totaling 188. But using the digit position approach, it's 187. So, which one is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps I double-counted somewhere. Let me check the two-digit numbers again. \n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99), the 4's in the tens place are 10 (40-49), and in the ones place, it's 9 (14,24,...,94). So, 10+9=19. That seems correct. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, using the digit position approach, hundreds place:89, tens place:50, ones place:48. Wait, but in the three-digit numbers, the ones place 4's would be from 100-488. Let me calculate that again. \n\nFrom 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? \n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences (e.g., 104,114,...,194; 204,214,...,294; etc.). So, from 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3\u00d710=30. From 400-488, the ones digit goes up to 8, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times. So, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30+9=39. \n\nWait, but earlier, using the digit position approach, I had 48 units place 4's. That included single-digit and two-digit numbers as well. Wait, no, in the digit position approach, I considered units, tens, and hundreds across all numbers. So, perhaps the confusion is between counting per digit position and per number range. \n\nWait, maybe I should reconcile these two methods. \n\nIn the first method: single-digit 4's:1, two-digit 4's:19, three-digit 4's:168. Total:1+19+168=188. \n\nIn the second method: units place 4's:48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total:48+50+89=187. \n\nThere's a discrepancy of 1. Hmm. Let me check where. \n\nWait, perhaps in the three-digit numbers, I'm missing a 4 in the hundreds place. Let me recount the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. \n\nIn the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. \n\nIn the units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Correct. \n\nSo, total 4's:48+50+89=187. \n\nBut in the first method, I had 188. So, where is the discrepancy? Let me check the first method again. \n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 4's:40-49 (10), ones place:14,24,...,94 (9). Total:19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place:400-488 (89). \n\nTens place:140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10). So, 4 sets? Wait, no, 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's 5 sets in total? Wait, no, 40-49 is in two-digit numbers, so in three-digit numbers, the tens place 4's start at 140-149, which is in three-digit numbers. So, from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? \n\nFrom 100-199:140-149 (10). \n\nFrom 200-299:240-249 (10). \n\nFrom 300-399:340-349 (10). \n\nFrom 400-488:440-449 (10). \n\nSo, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10, so total 40. \n\nWait, but in the digit position approach, I had 50 in the tens place. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, in the digit position approach, I considered all numbers from 1-488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. \n\nBut in the first method, when I broke down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I only counted the two-digit tens place as 10 (40-49) and the three-digit tens place as 30 (140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10. So, in the three-digit tens place, it's 30+10=40. \n\nSo, in the first method, the total tens place 4's are 10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit)=50. So, that's consistent with the digit position approach. \n\nSimilarly, in the first method, the units place 4's are: single-digit:0, two-digit:9 (14,24,...,94), and three-digit:39 (from 100-488). So, total units place 4's:9+39=48, which matches the digit position approach. \n\nSo, in the first method, the total 4's are: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (89+40+39)=1+19+168=188. \n\nBut in the digit position approach, it's 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187. \n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 1. I must have double-counted somewhere. Let me check. \n\nWait, perhaps in the three-digit numbers, the page 400 is counted in both hundreds and tens place? No, because in the hundreds place, it's only the hundreds digit, and in the tens place, it's the tens digit. So, 400 would contribute a 4 in the hundreds place and a 0 in the tens place, so no double-counting there. \n\nWait, but let me check specific numbers. For example, page 444: it has two 4's, one in the hundreds, one in the tens, and one in the ones. So, each digit is counted separately. So, in the hundreds place, it's counted once, in the tens place once, and in the ones place once. So, no double-counting. \n\nWait, but perhaps in the three-digit numbers, when I broke down into hundreds, tens, and ones, I included 400-488, which is correct. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's list all the 4's in each position. \n\nUnits place: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484-4=480, 480/10=48. So, 49 numbers? Wait, no, because 4 is the first, then 14,24,...,484. Let's see: the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,...,484. So, starting at 4, each step of 10. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. But wait, 484 is within 488, so that's correct. So, units place 4's:49. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48 because 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. But now, counting from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, gives 49 terms. So, which is correct? \n\nWait, let's see: from 1-10: one 4 (page 4). \n\n11-20: one 4 (14). \n\n21-30:24. \n\n... \n\n481-490:484. \n\nBut since the book ends at 488, 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond. So, how many terms? \n\nThe first term is 4, then 14,24,...,484. \n\nThe number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place 4's:49. \n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier by thinking it was 48. It's actually 49. \n\nSo, units place:49. \n\nTens place: as before, 50. \n\nHundreds place:89. \n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. \n\nAh, so that reconciles the two methods. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188. \n\nNow, let's move on to counting the number of 8's. \n\nSimilarly, I'll use the digit position approach. \n\nUnits place: every 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. How many? \n\nFrom 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's:49. \n\nTens place: every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100? 4 complete sets (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete set, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 sets \u00d710=40. \n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. \n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. \n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. \n\nWait, let me verify that. \n\nUnits place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total 8's:98. \n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. \n\nSo, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 sets \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49. \n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98. \n\nWait, but let me check if 480-488 is correctly counted. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each of these 9 numbers contributes an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. \n\nNow, so the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. \n\nWait, in the units place, 4's:49, 8's:49. \n\nIn the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49. \n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0. \n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188. \n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When I counted the 4's in the units place as 49, that includes page 4,14,24,...,484. Similarly, the 8's in the units place are 8,18,28,...,488. So, both have 49 occurrences. \n\nIn the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49. \n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0. \n\nSo, yes, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's were 188 and 8's 98, so 90 more 4's. \n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the 8's correctly. \n\nFrom 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. \n\nIn the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. \n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo find this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones digit):** \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - From 400 to 488, each number has a '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Similar to '4's, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It should be the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups of 10, and the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's correct, 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but the hundreds digit starts from 1 for three-digit numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: \n\n- From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 times.\n- From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 times.\n- From 200-299: 240-249, another 10 times.\n- From 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times.\n- From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 10 times. So, in total, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but does it go beyond that? No, because 488 is less than 500. So, yes, 50 times for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: \n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal number of 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. \n\nAgain, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct, 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, let's see how many blocks we have:\n\n- From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 times.\n- From 100-199: 180-189, another 10 times.\n- From 200-299: 280-289, another 10 times.\n- From 300-399: 380-389, another 10 times.\n- From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9.\n\nWait, so for the tens place, each block except the last one contributes 10 times, but the last one contributes 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times for the digit 8.\n\nSo, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal number of 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check the addition: 48 + 49 is 97. Yes.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times, which adds up to 49 in total for tens place. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits from 1 to 488. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 digits. 10-99: 90 numbers, each with 2 digits: 180 digits. 100-488: 389 numbers, each with 3 digits: 1167 digits. So total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. \n\nNow, total number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 90. Let me see if that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recount the 4's and 8's to make sure.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and the 48th group ends at 480, so 484 is included, so 48 times. Correct.\n\nTens place: from 1-99, 40-49: 10 times. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399: 340-349:10. 400-488: 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 times. So total 48+50+89=187. Correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 48 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 48+49=97. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. But wait, 488-400+1=89, yes. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 49 in total.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to determine how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, so 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 times. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, so 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 times, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9 times. So, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: Only page 4 has a 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99): I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but wait, since we're only considering two-digit numbers up to 99, the last number is 94. Let me count these: from 14 to 94, stepping by 10 each time. That's 9 numbers (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94), so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 44 has both tens and units as 4, so I've counted both places. So total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but hold on, 44 is included in both counts, but each occurrence is a separate digit, so it's correct to count both. So, 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). This is a bit more involved. Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: For numbers from 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. Let me count how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers: Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: The tens digit 4 appears in 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: The tens digit 4 appears in 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. Let me check: 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, but wait, our upper limit is 488, so 449 is included. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total in tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has exactly one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 10 per hundred. Since we have four hundred blocks up to 400-488, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Again, let's go through each hundred block.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit 4 appears in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, let me count: starting from 404, each 10 numbers. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 494 would be next, but 494 is beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, that adds up to 39. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Each hundred block up to 399 has 10 units digit 4's, and the last block (400-488) has 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) = 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers is 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times the digit 8 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: Only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99): Again, looking at tens and units places.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 all have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers ending with 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 88 has both tens and units as 8, so we've counted both places. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). Again, let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: For numbers from 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers up to 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers: Let's consider each hundred block.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit 8 appears in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: The tens digit 8 appears in 280-289. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: The tens digit 8 appears in 380-389. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: Let's go through each hundred block.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit 8 appears in 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208, 218, 228, 238, 248, 258, 268, 278, 288, 298. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 308, 318, 328, 338, 348, 358, 368, 378, 388, 398. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 498 would be next, but it's beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, that's 39. Let me check: 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds place, we had 0, so total 8's in three-digit numbers is 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 8's printed are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nTotal two-digit 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 4's.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 400s had 10, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 400-488 includes 440-449, so yes, 10. So, 40.\n\n- Units place: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39.\n\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 8's.\n\n- Units place: 18,28,...,98: 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nTotal two-digit 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39.\n\n- Units place: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct.

In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me think about how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The numbers would be 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. Now, for the units place, the 4 can be in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, the last one is 94. Let me count: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that affect the count? Hmm, I think I need to count each occurrence separately. So, in the tens place, it's 10 times, and in the units place, it's 9 times. So, total 4's in two-digit pages would be 10 + 9 = 19. But wait, 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. So, that's correct because it has two 4's. So, 19 4's in two-digit pages. Adding that to the single-digit page, which had 1, so total 4's so far are 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit pages, from 100 to 488. Let me break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but not beyond. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The 4 can appear in the tens or units place. So, similar to the two-digit case, but now the hundreds digit is 1. Let me calculate the number of 4's in the tens and units places for 100-199.\n\nIn the tens place, the numbers would be 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 4's.\n\nIn the units place, the numbers would be 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. Wait, but 144 has two 4's, so that's counted twice. So, total 10 + 10 = 20 4's in the 100-199 range.\n\nWait, but 100-199 is 100 numbers, right? So, in the tens place, 10 times, units place 10 times, and hundreds place 0 times because the hundreds digit is 1. So, total 20 4's.\n\nNext, hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, the 4 can appear in the tens or units place.\n\nTens place: 240-249, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294. Again, 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nTotal 4's in 200-299: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same approach.\n\nTens place: 340-349, 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place: 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394. 10 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4 (400-488): This is a bit trickier because it doesn't go up to 499, only 488. So, I need to adjust the count here.\n\nFirst, in the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, in the tens place: The tens digit can be 0-8, but since we're going up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8. So, let's see. The 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 4's.\n\nIn the units place: The 4 can be in any of the units positions, so numbers like 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but we're only going up to 488, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond. So, let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 444 has two 4's: one in the hundreds, one in the tens, and one in the units. But we've already counted the hundreds place separately, and the tens and units places separately. So, each occurrence is counted individually, so that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in the 400-488 range: hundreds place 89, tens place 10, units place 9. So, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 89, that's correct. Tens place: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Units place: from 404 to 484, stepping by 10, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - 100-199: 20\n  - 200-299: 20\n  - 300-399: 20\n  - 400-488: 108\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 108. Let me add these up step by step.\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n\n20 + 20 = 40\n\n40 + 20 = 60\n\n60 + 108 = 168\n\nWait, but wait, 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\nThen, 100-199:20, so 20 + 20 = 40\n\n200-299:20, so 40 + 20 = 60\n\n300-399:20, so 60 + 20 = 80\n\n400-488:108, so 80 + 108 = 188\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:108\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n\n20 + 20 = 40\n\n40 + 20 = 60\n\n60 + 20 = 80\n\n80 + 108 = 188\n\nYes, that's correct. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's printed. Let's go through the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages: only page 8, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit pages: from 10 to 99.\n\nIn the tens place: numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's.\n\nIn the units place: numbers 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, so let me count how many.\n\n18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But 88 has two 8's, so that's 9 8's in the units place, but 88 is counted twice, so total 9 + 1 (from 88's tens place) but wait, no, in the tens place, we've already counted 80-89, which includes 88. So, in the units place, 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 8, except 88, which has two. Wait, but when I count 18,28,...,98, that's 9 numbers, but 88 is one of them, so that's 9 8's in the units place, but 88 has two 8's, so total 9 + 1 = 10? Wait, no, because 88 is counted once in the units place and once in the tens place. So, in the units place, it's 9 numbers, each with one 8, but 88 has an extra 8 in the tens place, which we've already counted separately. So, the units place contributes 9 8's, and the tens place contributes 10 8's, so total 19 8's in two-digit pages.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For two-digit numbers, the 8's in the tens place are 10 (80-89), and in the units place, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 8's in two-digit pages.\n\nAdding the single-digit page 8, which is 1, so total 8's so far are 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nHundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n\nIn the tens place: numbers 180-189, which is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 8's.\n\nIn the units place: numbers 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\nHundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n\nSimilarly, tens place: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. 10 numbers.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n\nTens place: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. 10 numbers.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nHundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nNow, this is where it might be a bit different because we're only going up to 488.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: since the hundreds digit is 4, and we're only considering 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's there.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 0-8, but we're only going up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, numbers with 8 in the tens place would be 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so that's correct.\n\nIn the units place: numbers where the units digit is 8, so 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 has an 8 in both tens and units place. So, in the tens place, we've counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. In the units place, we have 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place, including 488.\n\nSo, total 8's in the 400-488 range:\n\nTens place: 9\n\nUnits place: 9\n\nSo, 9 + 9 = 18 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens place 8's are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. The units place 8's are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place. So, 9 + 9 = 18 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit pages:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:18\n\nAdding these up: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit 8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. So total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that again.\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:18\n\nSo, three-digit total:20+20+20+18=78\n\nTotal 8's:1 + 19 +78=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought about two-digit 8's, I had 19, which included single-digit 8? No, wait, no. Wait, single-digit 8 is separate. So, single-digit 8:1, two-digit 8's:19, three-digit 8's:78. So, total 1 +19 +78=98.\n\nNow, let me confirm that.\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through the 4's again:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:108\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20; 20+20=40; 40+20=60; 60+108=168.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 188, but now I'm getting 168. Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount the three-digit 4's.\n\nWait, in the three-digit 4's:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:108\n\nSo, 20+20+20=60, plus 108=168.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, total 4's:168.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 188, but that was a miscalculation. So, 168 4's.\n\nNow, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 168 - 98 = 70.\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 70 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the three-digit 4's count.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, we have:\n\nHundreds place:89 (since 400-488 is 89 numbers)\n\nTens place:10 (440-449)\n\nUnits place:9 (404,414,...,484)\n\nSo, 89 +10 +9=108.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:108\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:20+20+20+108=168.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nSo, 168 -98=70.\n\nTherefore, there are 70 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   \n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 numbers.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n   \n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - **100-199:**\n       - Tens place: 140-149 \u2192 10.\n       - Units place: 104, 114, ..., 194 \u2192 10.\n       - Total: 20.\n     - **200-299:**\n       - Tens place: 240-249 \u2192 10.\n       - Units place: 204, 214, ..., 294 \u2192 10.\n       - Total: 20.\n     - **300-399:**\n       - Tens place: 340-349 \u2192 10.\n       - Units place: 304, 314, ..., 394 \u2192 10.\n       - Total: 20.\n     - **400-488:**\n       - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89.\n       - Tens place: 440-449 \u2192 10.\n       - Units place: 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 9.\n       - Total: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 108 = **168**.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   \n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n   \n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - **100-199:**\n       - Tens place: 180-189 \u2192 10.\n       - Units place: 108, 118, ..., 198 \u2192 10.\n       - Total: 20.\n     - **200-299:**\n       - Tens place: 280-289 \u2192 10.\n       - Units place: 208, 218, ..., 298 \u2192 10.\n       - Total: 20.\n     - **300-399:**\n       - Tens place: 380-389 \u2192 10.\n       - Units place: 308, 318, ..., 398 \u2192 10.\n       - Total: 20.\n     - **400-488:**\n       - Tens place: 480-488 \u2192 9.\n       - Units place: 408, 418, ..., 488 \u2192 9.\n       - Total: 9 + 9 = 18.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 18 = **98**.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   \n   - Number of '4's: 168\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 168 - 98 = **70**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{70}"

    "text": " \n\nLet's start with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The two-digit numbers where the tens digit is 4 are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49), so that's 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The two-digit numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting each occurrence once, so in the units place, each of these numbers contributes one 4. So that's 9 occurrences in the units place.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 10 to 99, the units digits go from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's exactly one number where the units digit is 4. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 tens (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 numbers where the units digit is 4. So that's 9 occurrences in the units place.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- When the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, the digit 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, no contributions here.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4, that's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers:\nWe need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can look at how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. However, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers:\nSimilarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place.\n\nSo, let's calculate for each hundred:\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers.\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 numbers.\nFrom 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 numbers.\nFrom 400-488: Now, we have to be careful here because 400-488 isn't a full hundred. Let's see, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see, the first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the numbers ending with 4 in this range are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's list them: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, 39 in total for the units place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences of 4 in the entire book:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the two-digit numbers, I had 10 in the tens place (40-49) and 9 in the units place (14,24,...,94). So that's 19, which seems correct.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place in three-digit: 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 for 400-488, so 40. That's correct.\n\nUnits place in three-digit: 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 for 400-488, so 39. That adds up to 168 in three-digit. So total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99):\n- Tens place: Numbers where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences in the tens place.\n- Units place: Numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences in the units place.\nTotal two-digit 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers (100-488):\n- Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n- Tens place: Let's look at each hundred:\n  - 100-199: Tens digit is 8 in 180-189: 10 numbers.\n  - 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n  - 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n  - 400-488: Tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n  So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n- Units place: For each hundred, units digit is 8 every 10 numbers.\n  - 100-199: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198: 10 numbers.\n  - 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 numbers.\n  - 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 numbers.\n  - 400-488: Units digit 8 occurs in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488.\n  So, total in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place in 400-488. The numbers ending with 8 are 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, total in units place: 39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. In the units place, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nBut wait, let me check: 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n200-299: 10 + 10 = 20\n300-399: 10 + 10 = 20\n400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78. That's correct.\n\nNow, total 8's in the entire book:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, I had 78 8's. Let me verify that.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for three-digit numbers, 100-199: 180-189 is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 (480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, 100-199: 10 numbers ending with 8, same for 200-299 and 300-399, and 9 in 400-488. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 in units place.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 in three-digit numbers. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated 4's, I got 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again to make sure.\n\nSingle-digit: 4 appears once.\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Units place: 14,24,...,94: 9 numbers, so 9 4's. Total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: each 10 numbers, so 40 4's.\n- Units place: 104,114,...,194: 10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in three-digit numbers, I think I added hundreds, tens, and units correctly as 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, adding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\nThree-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188\n8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large difference. Let me check if I missed something.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's try that approach for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit 4:\n- From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more. So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49. Yes, that matches. So, 49 units digit 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\nFrom 1 to 488, same approach. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set includes 488, which ends with 8, so that's one more. So, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49. So, that's consistent.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor tens digit 4:\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there?\n\nFrom 1-99: tens digit 4 is in 40-49: 10 numbers.\nFrom 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers.\nFrom 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers.\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers.\nFrom 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I had in two-digit numbers: 10, and in three-digit numbers: 40. So, 10 + 40 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 8:\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers.\nFrom 100-199: 180-189:10\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\nWait, earlier I had in two-digit numbers: 10, and in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens place). So, 10 + 39 = 49. That's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\nOnly from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 8:\nSince the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 90 seemed high, but using this digit-by-digit approach, it's consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the number 444, how many 4's does it contribute? It contributes three 4's, so each digit place counts it once. So, in units, tens, and hundreds, each gets counted once, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in 488, how many 8's? It has two 8's, one in the tens and one in the units. So, in my counting, the tens place counts one 8, and the units place counts one 8, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 488 doesn't have an 8, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99): Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. Let's consider the tens place first. The two-digit numbers where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences. Now, for the ones place in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I count each occurrence. Let me list them: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but each contributes one 4 except 44, which contributes two. So, total 4's in the ones place for two-digit numbers would be 9 (from each of the numbers) plus 1 extra from 44, making it 10. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 10 (ones) = 20.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For the ones place, from 10-99, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the ones place, so that's 9 sets of 10 (since 10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), but wait, 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, but in the ones place, 44 is included. So, actually, from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? It's 9 times, because each ten has one 4, except that in the 40-49 range, the ones place 4 is already counted. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. From 10-99, for the ones place, 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, starting at 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, plus the 4 in 44's tens place, which we've already counted. So, in the ones place, it's 9 4's. Therefore, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so in the ones place, we have 9 numbers, but 44 contributes an extra 4 in the tens place, which we've already counted. So, the ones place in two-digit numbers would have 9 4's, and the tens place has 10 4's, totaling 19. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe it's better to consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor two-digit numbers, the tens place can be from 1 to 9, and the ones place from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, when it's 4, there are 10 numbers (40-49), each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so 10 4's. For the ones place, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the ones digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. There are 9 sets (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 4's in the ones place. Therefore, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. But wait, 44 is in both the tens and ones places, so does that mean we're counting two 4's for 44? Yes, because 44 has two 4's, so in the tens place, we count one, and in the ones place, we count another. So, in total, 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19, which correctly accounts for both 4's in 44.\n\nSo, moving on. Now, for three-digit page numbers (100-488). Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when it's 4, the tens and ones digits are limited.\n\nLet's count the 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100-488. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149). So, 10 times for each hundred.\n\n- For 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249).\n\n- For 300-399: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349).\n\n- For 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's go through each hundred.\n\n- 100-199: The ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the ones digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred.\n\n- 200-299: Similarly, ones digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\n- 300-399: Ones digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\n- 400-488: The ones digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, but we have to see how many complete sets of ten are there. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. How many times does the ones digit 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, let's count: starting at 404, each 10 numbers adds one. So, from 404 to 484, that's 9 numbers (404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484). So, 9 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 488, so 484 is included, but 494 is beyond. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each hundred except the last one (400-488), the ones digit 4 appears exactly 10 times. For 400-488, it's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, yes, 39 in total.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + ones place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (ones) = 168. So, total 4's from 100-488 is 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. Yes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Let's break it down into tens and ones places.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: In each set of ten numbers (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the ones digit 8 appears once. So, from 10-99, there are 9 sets, each contributing one 8 in the ones place, so 9 8's. But wait, in the 80-89 range, the ones digit 8 is already counted in the tens place. So, in the ones place, it's 8 numbers: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Wait, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place. But 88 has two 8's, so we have to make sure we count both. So, in the ones place, it's 9 8's, but 88 contributes an extra 8 in the tens place, which we've already counted. So, the ones place contributes 9 8's.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For the ones place in two-digit numbers, from 10-99, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 10-19: 18; 20-29:28; 30-39:38; 40-49:48; 50-59:58; 60-69:68; 70-79:78; 80-89:88; 90-99:98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place. So, 9 8's in the ones place. However, 88 has an 8 in both tens and ones places, so in the tens place, we've already counted 10 8's (from 80-89), and in the ones place, we're counting 9 8's, including the one from 88. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both counts, so we're counting both 8's in 88 correctly. So, total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers (100-488).\n\nLet's break it down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: We need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488.\n\nLet's consider each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 8's.\n\n- 200-299: Tens digit 8 appears in 280-289, 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n- 300-399: Tens digit 8 appears in 380-389, 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n- 400-488: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers:\n\nAgain, let's go through each hundred.\n\n- 100-199: The ones digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred. So, 10 8's.\n\n- 200-299: Similarly, 10 8's.\n\n- 300-399: 10 8's.\n\n- 400-488: The ones digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. Let's see how many times. From 400-488, the ones digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in the ones place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + ones place (39) = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Tens place: 39, ones place: 39, so total 78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n\n- Two-digit: 19 (tens:10, ones:9, total 19) correct.\n\n- Three-digit: hundreds 89, tens 40, ones 39, total 168. So, 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Correct.\n\n8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n\n- Two-digit: 19 (tens:10, ones:9, total 19) correct.\n\n- Three-digit: tens 39, ones 39, total 78. So, 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 90. Let me see if I missed something.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the ones place, when counting 4's in 400-488, I counted 9 4's because 484 is the last one. Similarly, for 8's, in 400-488, the ones place 8's are up to 488, which includes 488, so 408, 418, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 400-488, the 8's are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit 4's again. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49 in each hundred, so 10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, but wait, no. Wait, in the tens place, for three-digit numbers, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so 40 in total. Correct.\n\nOnes place: 10 per hundred for the first three hundreds, and 9 for the last. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nTens place: 10 per hundred for the first three, and 9 for the last. 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOnes place: 10 per hundred for the first three, and 9 for the last. 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 39+39=78. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the two-digit numbers for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place, but 88 has two 8's, so in the ones place, we have 9 8's, and in the tens place, we have 10 8's, so total 19 8's in two-digit numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in two-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:40-49, 10 4's.\n\nOnes place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so in the ones place, we have 9 4's, and in the tens place, 10 4's, total 19. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is page 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: In the range 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but 40-49 is one of those tens, so I think I might have double-counted there. Let me check: when I counted the tens place, I included all the 40-49, and when I count the units place, I also include 40-49 but only the units digit. So, for example, 44 has both a tens and a units digit as 4. So, in the units place, in each ten, 4 appears once, so for 9 tens (excluding 40-49?), no, wait, no, 40-49 is part of the two-digit numbers, so I think the units place count should include all the tens, including 40-49. So, for the units place, from 10-99, every ten has a 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times (from 14, 24, ..., 94). So, 9 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. Then, for the units place, from 10-99, every ten has a 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times (14,24,...,94). So, 10 + 9 = 19. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more involved because each page number now has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each of these positions.\n\nFirst, let's break down the three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n1. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred.\n\n3. Units place: Similarly, the units digit can be 0-9 for each hundred.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's in each position separately across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's here.\n- Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, no 4's.\n- Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, no 4's.\n- Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4. Now, how many numbers are here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 can appear in any hundred. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times 4 in the tens place here.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, 10 numbers, so another 10 times.\n- For 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers, another 10 times.\n- For 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Now, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, 10 times 4 in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 440-449 is the only set where the tens digit is 4. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nNow, units place:\n\nAgain, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every ten numbers.\n\n- For 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 times.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times.\n- For 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times.\n- For 400-488: Now, the units digit is 4 in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 400-488?\n\nLet's see: Starting from 400, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 is the first, then each 10 after that. So, from 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 4?\n\nLet me calculate: The first is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 times 4 in the units place here.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488, so that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add the 4's from single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit count because 168 seems a lot. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, from 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each, except for 400-488, where it's 10 as well because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, 4 times 10 is 40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each have 10 units digits of 4, so 30. Then, 400-488 has 9, so total 39. That adds up to 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, at page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place: In each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 tens, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, no 8's.\n- 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, no 8's.\n- 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, no 8's.\n- 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, no 8's.\n\nSo, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range x80-x89.\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times 8 in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each hundred, the units digit is 8 once every ten numbers.\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 times.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 times.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 times.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? Starting at 408, each 10 numbers: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488 for units digit 8. The last number is 488, so 488 is included, making it 9 numbers. So, 9 units digits of 8 in 400-488.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 78.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\nSingle-digit: 8 \u2192 1\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\nThree-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens: 40 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-488)\n- Units: 39 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488)\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 (correct)\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens: 10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488 \u2192 39\n- Units: 10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488 \u2192 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 (correct)\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct based on the calculations. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I overcounted somewhere? For example, in the three-digit numbers, when counting 4's in the tens place, I considered 10 each in 100-199, etc., but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 goes up to 449, which is within 488, so that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, for 400-488, I counted 9, which is correct because 484 is the last one before 488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place, and in the units place, 408,418,...,488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. That adds up correctly.\n\nI think the counts are accurate. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n   - **Units place:** 14, 24, ..., 94 \u2192 9 times.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - **Units place:** 104, 114, ..., 194; 204, ..., 294; 304, ..., 394; 404, ..., 484 \u2192 10 each for the first three hundreds and 9 for 400-488, totaling 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):**\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n   - **Units place:** 18, 28, ..., 98 \u2192 9 times.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - **Tens place:** 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 each for the first three hundreds and 9 for 480-488, totaling 39.\n   - **Units place:** 108, 118, ..., 198; 208, ..., 298; 308, ..., 398; 408, ..., 488 \u2192 10 each for the first three hundreds and 9 for 408-488, totaling 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9), the digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. Now, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the range 40-49, which is 10 times (40,41,...,49). In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, so from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I should be careful not to double count. Let me list them: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 except 44, which has two. So, actually, in the units place for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 9 times, but 44 adds an extra one. So total for two-digit numbers: tens place gives 10, units place gives 9, but 44 adds one more, so total 10 + 9 +1 = 20? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. For two-digit numbers, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (40-49). In the units place, it's 9 times (14,24,...,94), which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 4. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 +9=19. Plus the single-digit 4, so total 19+1=20. Hmm, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so maybe I should count each digit separately. So, in two-digit numbers, the tens place has 10 4's, and the units place has 9 4's, but 44 is counted in both, so the total number of 4's is 10 +9=19. Then, adding the single-digit 4, which is another 1, so total 20 4's from 1-99.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but only 100-399 and 400-488. So, the hundreds place contributes 4's only in the range 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. Let's consider how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100-488. \n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149. So, 10 4's in the tens place.\n\n- Similarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3: Each will have 10 4's in the tens place (240-249, 340-349). So that's 2 more hundreds, each contributing 10, so 20 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but we have to check if 449 is within 488. Yes, it is. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10 (from 100-199) + 20 (from 200-399) +10 (from 400-488) = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: From 100-199, the units digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 204,214,...,294: 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 304,314,...,394: 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers? Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the units digit 4 would appear every 10 numbers, so 8 full decades (400-480) would have 8 4's, and then 484 is the ninth. Wait, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 numbers. So, 9 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2) +10 (hundreds 3) +9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds digit 4, from 400 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? The first is 404, then every 10 pages: 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So yes, 9 times. So total units place 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n- Plus single-digit and two-digit: 20\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I calculated the 4's from 1-99 as 20, which includes the single-digit and two-digit pages. Then, from 100-488, I have hundreds, tens, and units places. So, the total 4's would be 20 (from 1-99) + 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 20+89=109, 109+40=149, 149+39=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-99: 20 4's. From 100-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (since 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place)\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal from 100-488: 89+40+39=168\nSo total 4's: 20+168=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place.\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But 88 has two 8's, so we need to count each digit separately. So, in the units place, it's 9 8's, but 88 adds an extra one in the tens place as well. Wait, no, the tens place for 88 is already counted in the tens place count. So, in the units place, 18,28,...,98: 9 numbers, each contributing one 8, so 9 8's. Plus, in the tens place, 80-89: 10 8's. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 +9=19. Plus the single-digit 8: 1, so total 19+1=20 8's from 1-99.\n\nNow, three-digit pages (100-488):\n\n- Hundreds place: 800-899 would have 8's in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit can be 8. So, let's break it down:\n\n  - Hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place.\n  - Hundreds digit 2: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n  - Hundreds digit 3: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n  - Hundreds digit 4: 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2) +10 (hundreds 3) +9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\n- Units place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So:\n\n  - Hundreds digit 1: 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers.\n  - Hundreds digit 2: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n  - Hundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n  - Hundreds digit 4: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit and two-digit: 20\n- Tens place in three-digit: 39\n- Units place in three-digit: 39\nTotal 8's: 20+39+39=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-99: 20 8's. From 100-488:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nSo, 39+39=78\nTotal 8's: 20+78=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- 1-99: 20\n- 100-488:\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Tens: 40\n  - Units:39\nTotal: 20+89+40+39=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- 1-99:20\n- 100-488:\n  - Tens:39\n  - Units:39\nTotal:20+39+39=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10\n     - 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10\n     - 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10\n     - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n   - **Units place:** \n     - 100-199: 104, 114, ..., 194 \u2192 10\n     - 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294 \u2192 10\n     - 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394 \u2192 10\n     - 400-488: 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 9\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\n4. **Total 4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n     - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10\n     - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10\n     - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - **Units place:** \n     - 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198 \u2192 10\n     - 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298 \u2192 10\n     - 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398 \u2192 10\n     - 400-488: 408, 418, ..., 488 \u2192 9\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total 8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I think I should separate the counting for the tens and units places to avoid missing any. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: the numbers 40 to 49 have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 occurrences (40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49). \n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers: the 4 appears in numbers like 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I counted it twice? Hmm, but in this case, I'm only counting the units place, so each occurrence is separate. So, 9 times in the units place. \n\nWait, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's place (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten (10-99), so 9 occurrences. But wait, 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so does that affect the units place? No, because in 40-49, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once in the units place there as well. So, that's 10 in the tens place and 9 in the units place, making 19 occurrences of 4 in two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 10-99, the tens place has 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The units place has 4 in 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, which is 9 numbers. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4 in two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm double-counting? Hmm, no, because when I count the tens place, I'm counting each 4 in the tens place, regardless of what's in the units place, and when I count the units place, I'm counting each 4 in the units place, regardless of the tens digit. So, 44 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, so that's correct. So, total 19 occurrences of 4 in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count the number of 4's in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: In the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. I need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break this down by hundreds. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 for 440-449. But wait, does 449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 10 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294. Another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394. Another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit is 4 in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 400-488, so that's 9 numbers because 404 to 484 is every 10 numbers, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so from 404 to 484, that's 9 occurrences (since 404,414,...,484). Wait, let me check: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first and 484 is the ninth. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but is 484 included? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, total in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10, so 404,414,...,484. How many are there? From 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the units place: 39.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 100-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences in the units place, so 10*3=30. Then, from 400-488, it's 9 occurrences, making total 39. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: from 100-199, 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 10.\n\n300-399:10.\n\n400-488: from 404 to 484, which is 9 numbers as above.\n\nSo, total units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, in the three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is:\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTens place:40\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal:89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me check that addition: 89+40=129, 129+39=168. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit:19 (as calculated earlier)\n\nThree-digit:168.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: from 1-9, only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10-99.\n\nAgain, tens place and units place.\n\nTens place: numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: numbers where the units digit is 8, which are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 occurrences. Wait, 88 is included in both, but we're counting separately for tens and units. So, 9 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10+9=19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: from 100-488.\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: in three-digit numbers, the tens digit is 8. Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: in three-digit numbers, the units digit is 8.\n\nAgain, by hundreds:\n\nFrom 100-199: numbers ending with 8:108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10.\n\nFrom 200-299:208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. Another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399:308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. Another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: numbers ending with 8:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 408 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 408 is the first, then every 10 up to 488). Let me check: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Yes, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in units place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place, we had 39, and in the units place, 39, so total 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit numbers again, because that's where most of the counts are.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89.\n\nTens place: in each hundred (100-199, etc.), 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (100-399 and 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, from 100-199:140-149:10\n\n200-299:240-249:10\n\n300-399:340-349:10\n\n400-488:440-449:10\n\nSo, 10*4=40.\n\nUnits place: in each hundred, 10 numbers ending with 4. So, 100-199:104,114,...,194:10\n\n200-299:204,...,294:10\n\n300-399:304,...,394:10\n\n400-488:404,...,484:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:180-189:10\n\n280-289:10\n\n380-389:10\n\n480-488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nUnits place:108,118,...,198:10\n\n208,...,298:10\n\n308,...,398:10\n\n408,...,488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 each, total 40.\n     - Units place: 104,114,...,194; 204,...,294; 304,...,394; 404,...,484 \u2192 10+10+10+9=39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences (since 800-899 exceeds 488).\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10+10+10+9=39.\n     - Units place: 108,118,...,198; 208,...,298; 308,...,398; 408,...,488 \u2192 10+10+10+9=39.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nMoving on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. The tens digit being 4 means the page numbers are from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, for the units place, the digit 4 appears every 10 pages, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but page numbers only go up to 99, so from 14 to 94, that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 44 is included in both the tens and units place, so I should make sure not to double count. Hmm, no, actually, when I count the tens place, I'm counting all the 40-49 pages, which includes 44. Then, when I count the units place, I'm looking for 4s in the units digit, which would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 4's. Then, for the units place, the 4's are in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which range from 100 to 488. So, let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds place, when the digit is 4, that's pages 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, but we're interested in when it's 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149, which is 10 pages. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 pages. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10 pages. And in 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 4 sets of 10 pages each, totaling 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the 400-488 range, does the tens digit go up to 4? Yes, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's correct, 10 pages. So, 4 sets of 10, so 40 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundred, in each ten, the units digit will be 4 once. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences (e.g., 104, 114, 124, ..., 194 in the 100-199 range). So, how many hundreds do we have? From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Let's check each.\n\n100-199: The units digit 4 occurs 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194).\n200-299: Similarly, 10 times (204, 214, ..., 294).\n300-399: 10 times (304, 314, ..., 394).\n400-488: Now, here, the units digit 4 occurs from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, how many times does the units digit 4 occur here? Let's see: starting at 404, each 10 pages, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up, units digit 4 in three-digit numbers is 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. Then, 400-488: 404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, yes, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129. Then, 129 + 39 (units) = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's total up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check each step again.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (only page 4)\nTwo-digit: 10 (40-49) in tens place, and 9 (14,24,...,94) in units place, so 19. That seems correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up all 4's: 1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in pages like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 occurrences because page 88 is included in both the tens and units place, but we're just counting the units digit here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when counting units digit, 88 is included, but it's counted once for the units place. So, from 18,28,...,98, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So, total in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, when hundreds digit is 8, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be up to 4. So, there are no three-digit page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, for 100-199, the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189: 10 pages. Similarly, in 200-299: 280-289:10 pages. In 300-399:380-389:10 pages. In 400-488: the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8. So, for each hundred, in each ten, the units digit 8 occurs once. So, let's check each hundred.\n\n100-199: 108,118,128,...,198: 10 occurrences.\n200-299: 208,218,...,298:10.\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10.\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, but 498 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, units digit 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) =78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Tens place: 10+10+10+9=39. Units place: same, 10+10+10+9=39. So, 39+39=78.\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal 8's=1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:168\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+78=98. That seems correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers, especially for the units digit in 400-488. When I counted units digit 4 in 400-488, I got 9 occurrences (404,414,...,484). Similarly, for units digit 8, I got 9 occurrences (408,418,...,488). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the three-digit counts.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place:140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each 10, so 40.\n- Units place:100-199,200-299,300-399: each 10, and 400-488:9, so 39.\nTotal:89+40+39=168.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:0, since hundreds digit can't be 8.\n- Tens place:180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10+10+10+9=39.\n- Units place:108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10), 308,...,398 (10), 408,...,488 (9): 10+10+10+9=39.\nTotal:39+39=78.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if I missed any pages. For example, in the single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit counts, did I cover all possible pages up to 488?\n\nSingle-digit:1-9, yes.\n\nTwo-digit:10-99, yes.\n\nThree-digit:100-488, yes.\n\nSo, I think I covered all page numbers. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 has a 4. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Pages 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 104, 114, ..., 194 (10); 204, ..., 294 (10); 304, ..., 394 (10); 404, ..., 484 (9) \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 has an 8. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: No pages since the maximum is 488. \u2192 0 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Pages 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 108, 118, ..., 198 (10); 208, ..., 298 (10); 308, ..., 398 (10); 408, ..., 488 (9) \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4. Now, moving on to two-digit pages: from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. So, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the ones place. \n\nFor the tens place: the numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4. \n\nFor the ones place: in every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so 9 occurrences. Wait, but actually, from 10-99, it's 9 sets of ten, right? So, 9 times 1, which is 9. But wait, in the two-digit numbers, the first set is 10-19, then 20-29, up to 90-99. So that's 9 sets, each contributing one 4 in the ones place. So, 9 times 1 equals 9. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 times. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: from 100 to 488. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and ones places. So, I need to consider each place separately. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For the tens place, 4 can appear in any of the hundreds groups. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 300-399: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349, another 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences. \n\nSo, in total, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred group, the ones digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred group, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. \n\nIn 100-199: The ones digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10. \n\nIn 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10. \n\nIn 400-488: Now, here, the ones digit is 4 in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, from 404 to 484, that's how many numbers? Let me see: starting at 404, each 10 numbers, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the 9th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 404 is the first, then adding 10 each time: 414 (2), 424 (3), 434 (4), 444 (5), 454 (6), 464 (7), 474 (8), 484 (9). So, 9 occurrences in 400-488. \n\nSo, for the ones place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168 times. \n\nNow, let me add up all the occurrences of 4 in single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. \n\nSingle-digit: 1 \nTwo-digit: 19 \nThree-digit: 168 \nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the three-digit numbers. Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. \n\nIn the tens place, I had 40 occurrences, which seems correct because each hundred group from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488 each contributed 10, so 4 times 10 is 40. \n\nIn the ones place, I had 39, which was 10 + 10 + 10 + 9. That seems correct because in 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears 9 times instead of 10 because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a ones digit 4. \n\nSo, 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. \n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll need to do a similar analysis for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with single-digit pages: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 8. \n\nNext, two-digit pages: from 10 to 99. Again, considering the tens and ones places. \n\nIn the tens place: the numbers from 80 to 89 all have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nIn the ones place: in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the ones place. So, from 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99, that's 9 sets, each contributing one 8. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 8 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 times. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: from 100 to 488. Again, considering hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits are only 1, 2, 3, 4. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: For each hundred group, the tens digit can be 8. \n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. \n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, 280-289, another 10. \n\nIn 300-399: 380-389, another 10. \n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. \n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences. \n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred group, the ones digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every ten numbers. \n\nIn 100-199: The ones digit is 8 in 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers. \n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10. \n\nIn 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10. \n\nIn 400-488: The ones digit is 8 in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488. So, from 408 to 488, that's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, in the ones place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78 times. \n\nNow, let me add up all the occurrences of 8 in single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. \n\nSingle-digit: 1 \nTwo-digit: 19 \nThree-digit: 78 \nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. \n\nIn single-digit: 8 is just once. \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10, ones place 9, total 19. \n\nThree-digit: tens place 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39, ones place 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nSo, 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That seems correct. \n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. \n\nLet me recount the 4's and 8's separately. \n\nFor 4's: \n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), ones place 9 (4 in 14,24,...,94). So, 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (10 per hundred group for 4 groups), ones place 39 (10 per hundred group for first three, then 9 in 400-488). So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\nFor 8's: \n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), ones place 9 (8 in 18,28,...,98). So, 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nThree-digit: tens place 39 (10 each in 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 in 400-488). Ones place 39 (10 each in first three hundreds, 9 in 400-488). So, 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me think if I counted correctly. \n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place across all page numbers. \n\nStarting with the units place: \n\nFor 4's in units place: \n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each set of 10, there's one 4. \n\nTotal number of sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). \n\nSo, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times in the full sets, plus one more in 484. Wait, no, 484 is in the 480-489 set, but since we're only going up to 488, 484 is included, so that's 48 full sets (each contributing one 4) plus one more in the partial set (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 total 4's, which includes hundreds, tens, and units. Hmm, perhaps this method is conflicting with my previous approach. Maybe I should stick to the place-by-place counting as I did before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. \n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. \n\nIn the tens place for 4's: in each hundred group, 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 100-199: 10 (140-149), 200-299: 10 (240-249), 300-399: 10 (340-349), 400-488: 10 (440-449). So, 40. \n\nIn the units place for 4's: in each hundred group, 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. So, 100-199: 10 (104,114,...,194), 200-299: 10 (204,...,294), 300-399: 10 (304,...,394), 400-488: 9 (404,...,484). So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit numbers, plus 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 188. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's: \n\nIn the units place: \n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each set of 10, one 8. \n\nNumber of full sets of 10: 48 (1-480), plus 8 extra pages (481-488). \n\nSo, in units place, 48 full sets contribute 48 eights, and in the extra 8 pages, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 in the ones place for three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the methods. Let me stick to the previous approach where I counted each place separately. \n\nIn the previous approach, for 8's in three-digit numbers, the ones place was 39, which included 10 in each of the first three hundreds and 9 in 400-488. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nBut when I think about the entire range, from 1-488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is indeed 49, as I just calculated. So, perhaps my earlier method was missing something. \n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the ones place for 8's is 39, but that's only from 100-488. But from 1-99, the ones place for 8's is 9 (pages 8,18,...,98). So, total ones place 8's: 9 (single and two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 48. Plus, in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's one more, making it 49. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial count for 8's was incorrect. Let me recalculate the total number of 8's. \n\nUsing the place-by-place approach for 8's: \n\nUnits place: \n\nFrom 1-99: 10 occurrences (8,18,...,98). \n\nFrom 100-488: In each hundred group, 10 occurrences in the units place, except the last group (400-488) which has 9. So, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nPlus, in 488, the units digit is 8, but 488 is included in 400-488, so that's already counted in the 9. Wait, no, 488 is part of the 400-488 group, so the 9 includes 408,418,...,488. So, that's correct. \n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 (1-99) + 39 (100-488) = 49. \n\nTens place: \n\nFrom 1-99: 10 occurrences (80-89). \n\nFrom 100-488: 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199,200-299,300-399) and 9 in 400-488 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (1-99) + 39 (100-488) = 49. \n\nHundreds place: \n\nFrom 1-99: 0. \n\nFrom 100-488: 0, since hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. \n\nSo, total hundreds place 8's: 0. \n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. \n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, 98 total 8's. \n\nBut when I calculated units place 8's as 49, and tens place 8's as 49, that adds up to 98. So, that's consistent. \n\nSo, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. I double-checked the counts, and everything seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only page number with a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4. \n\nMoving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me calculate each separately. \n\nFirst, the tens place: the numbers 40-49. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\nNext, the units place: the numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I should be careful not to double count. But since I'm counting each occurrence, 44 will contribute two 4's. Let me count them: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so total 4's in the units place are 10 (since 44 contributes two). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. \n\nIn the units place, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 10-99, there are 9 ten's groups (10-19 up to 90-99). Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 4's. But wait, in the 40-49 group, the units digit is 4 only in 44, which is already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, I'm considering the units place separately, so 40-49: the units digit 4 occurs in 44, but that's within the 40-49 group. So, actually, in each ten's group, the units digit 4 occurs once. So from 10-99, there are 9 ten's groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 4's. But wait, that's not including the 40-49 group where the tens digit is 4. So, in the tens place, we have 10 4's (40-49), and in the units place, we have 9 4's (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). Wait, but 44 is in both, so when I count the units place, 44's units digit is an additional 4, so total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. But wait, 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units, so that's correct because it has two 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 19.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 10-99, tens digit 4: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place: that's 10 4's. Units digit 4: in each ten's group, the units digit 4 occurs once, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So that's 9 4's. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, so that's correct because 44 has two 4's. So, yes, 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Here, each page number is a three-digit number, so we have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But for the hundreds digit, 4 appears only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 240-249: 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 340-349: 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 10 (for 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 4's.\n\nWait, but hold on. For 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488. Let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The units digit 4 occurs in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, let me count: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs once in each ten's group. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 to 484 is 9 numbers, each 10 apart. So that's 9 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth one after 404. So, yes, 9 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit count. Hmm, 89 in the hundreds place, 40 in the tens, 39 in the units: 89+40=129, 129+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only page number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nMoving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nFirst, the tens place: numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place: 10 8's.\n\nNext, the units place: numbers 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, so when I count the units place, 88's units digit is an additional 8. So, in the units place, from 10-99, we have 9 8's (18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98). So that's 9 8's. But 88 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, so that's correct because it has two 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nWait, that's the same as the 4's in two-digit numbers. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, and the hundreds digit is only up to 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 280-289: 10 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 380-389: 10 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 8 appears in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: from 408 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm for 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the three-digit numbers? Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nIn the three-digit numbers, for 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: 10 in each hundred except the last, which has 10 as well? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 10 for each hundred, but for 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, 10 for each hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40.\n\nUnits place: 10 in each hundred except the last, which had 9 because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 10 +10 +10 +9=39.\n\nSo, 89 +40 +39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 10 in each hundred except the last, which had 9 because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n- Units place: 10 in each hundred except the last, which had 9 because 488 is the last. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\nTotal: 39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a chance I double-counted some numbers? For example, in two-digit numbers, 44 has two 4's, so that's correctly counted as two 4's. Similarly, in three-digit numbers, numbers like 404 have two 4's, but I think I counted each occurrence separately, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 each, totaling 40.\n     - Units place: 104,114,...,484 \u2192 10 each for hundreds 1-3, and 9 for 400-488 \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 each for first three, 9 for last \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: 108,118,...,488 \u2192 10 each for hundreds 1-3, 9 for 400-488 \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4 in the single-digit pages.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. Here, I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place, the digit 4 can appear in the tens position. So, pages 40 to 49 will have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, each contributing one 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the units place, the digit 4 can appear in the units position every 10 pages. So, in the range 10-99, the 4's in the units place occur at 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 occurrences. Wait, but I should check if 44 is included in both counts. Oh, right, 44 has a 4 in both tens and units, so it's counted twice. But since I'm counting separately for tens and units, that's okay. So, 9 more 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit page numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more involved because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have a 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have a 2, 300-399 have a 3, and 400-488 have a 4. \n\nSo, the digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from page 400 to 488. Let me calculate how many pages that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in any hundred block. So, in the 100-199 range, the tens digit can be 4, making the numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, in the 200-299 range, the tens digit 4 gives 240-249, another 10 occurrences. Same for 300-399: 340-349, 10 more. And in 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, adding those up: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The digit 4 can appear in the units place in each hundred block. For each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so every 10 pages, there's a 4 in the units place. \n\nIn the 100-199 range: 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, in the 200-299 range: 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294. Another 10.\n\nIn the 300-399 range: 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394. Another 10.\n\nIn the 400-488 range: Let's see, starting from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 occurrences because 484 is the 9th number (since 404 is the first, then every 10 up to 484). Wait, let me check: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first, then adding 10 each time up to 484. Wait, but 404 + 10*8 = 484, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences in the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 400-488 units place. The first number is 404, then 414, up to 484. How many terms are there? Let's see: 404 is the first, then 414 (2nd), 424 (3rd), 434 (4th), 444 (5th), 454 (6th), 464 (7th), 474 (8th), 484 (9th). So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Hundreds place: 89, correct because 400-488 is 89 pages. Tens place: 40, correct because each hundred has 10, and there are four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, but for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, that's correct. So, 10 per hundred block, four blocks, so 40.\n\nUnits place: in each hundred block, 10 occurrences except the last one, which has 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40=129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nTens place: In each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 10 pages each. So, 10 for each of the first three, and 10 for the last, but wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, but the tens digit cycles every 10, so 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's 10. So, total 40.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred block, 10 occurrences except the last one. 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's see: 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 + 10*8 = 484, so 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40=129, plus 39=168. So, three-digit 4's: 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 8 is one of them, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place: 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: 8 can appear in the units place every 10 pages: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 occurrences because 88 is included in both tens and units, but we're counting separately.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 8 cannot appear in the hundreds place because the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: In each hundred block, the tens digit can be 8, giving 10 numbers each. So, in 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100s) +10 (200s) +10 (300s) +9 (400s) = 39.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred block, the units digit 8 occurs every 10 pages. So, in 100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10. 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10. 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 408 is the first, then every 10 up to 488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20 +78=98.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the three-digit numbers, in the units place for 4's, I had 39, and for 8's, I also had 39. Similarly, in the tens place, 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's. Hmm, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for 4's:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal:168\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTens place:39\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal:78\n\nSo, 168+19+1=188 for 4's.\n\nAnd 78+19+1=98 for 8's.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n- **Two-digit (10-99):** \n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n  - Units place: 9 occurrences (14,24,...,94).\n  - Total: 19.\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n  - Tens place: 40 occurrences (140-149, etc.).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (104,114,...,484).\n  - Total: 168.\n- **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n- **Two-digit (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n  - Units place: 9 occurrences (18,28,...,98).\n  - Total: 19.\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\n  - Tens place: 39 occurrences (180-189, etc.).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (108,118,...,488).\n  - Total: 78.\n- **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4. \n\nFor the units place: In two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's exactly one number where the units digit is 4. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 more 4's. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when it's 4, the tens and units digits are limited. \n\nBut wait, I think I need to handle the hundreds place separately. Let me think. For the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each hundred (like 100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 100-399, that's three full hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30. \n\nNow, for the hundreds 400-488, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8, meaning the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449). So that's another 10 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every ten numbers, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the units place 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199). \n\nFrom 100-399, that's three hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 3 * 10 = 30. \n\nFor 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since 488 is the last page, we need to check how many complete tens we have. From 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last ten (480-488). So, in each ten, 4 appears once in the units place. How many tens are there? From 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 400-409 is the first ten, then 410-419, up to 480-488. So that's 9 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the units digit goes up to 8, so the 4 in the units place would be at 484. So, yes, only one 4 in the units place for this last partial hundred. So, total for the units place in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 400-488, the units digit for each ten is 0-9 except the last one, which is 0-8. So, for each ten, the units digit 4 appears once. So, how many tens are there from 400-488? Let's see: 400-409 is the first ten, then 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. So that's 9 tens (since 488 is the 8th ten after 400). So, 9 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 is 89 numbers, but when considering the units place, it's 9 occurrences. Hmm, that seems correct because in each ten, 4 appears once in the units place, and there are 9 tens in 400-488.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. Wait, that can't be right because 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, for three-digit numbers, we have 3 full hundreds (100-399) each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 3*10=30, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, so total 40. Similarly, in the units place, 3 full hundreds each contributing 10, so 30, plus in 400-488, 9 more, so 39. So total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89. Tens place: 40. Units place: 39. Total 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. \n\nSingle-digit: 1. Two-digit: 19. Three-digit: 168. So total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, let's recount the two-digit numbers. From 10 to 99, the 4's in the tens place are 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. In the units place, for each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 tens (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 4's. So total 10 + 9 = 19. That seems correct.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, let's check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers: For 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 3*10=30. For 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total 40. That's correct.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: For 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4, so 3*10=30. For 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once in each ten, and there are 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). So 9 occurrences. So total 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 in three-digit numbers. Plus single-digit 1 and two-digit 19: 1 + 19 = 20. 20 + 168 = 188. So total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Again, we'll check the tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: In each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 such sets, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Again, we'll check hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers each. \n\nFrom 100-399: There are three hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences in the tens place, so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-489 is a set where the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, that's 9 occurrences of 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once in each ten. So, from 100-399: three hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences (since in each ten, units digit 8 appears once), so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit 8 appears once in each ten. How many tens are there? From 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). So, in each ten, units digit 8 appears once, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 78 = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So 1 +19=20, 20+78=98. So total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit 8's again. Hundreds place:0, tens place:39, units place:39. So total 78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10, units place 9 (14,24,...,94), total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place:100-399:3*10=30, 400-488:10 (440-449), total 40.\n\nUnits place:100-399:3*10=30, 400-488:9 (404,414,...,484), total 39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit. Plus 1+19=20. 20+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page8).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89:10, units place 9 (18,28,...,98), total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTens place:100-399:3*10=30, 400-488:9 (480-488), total 39.\n\nUnits place:100-399:3*10=30, 400-488:9, total 39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit. Plus 1+19=20. 20+78=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's that high. Let me see if I can find another way to calculate this, maybe by considering each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1-488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each complete decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 4's, which includes units, tens, and hundreds. Hmm, so according to this, units place 4's:49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 in three-digit numbers plus 1 in single-digit, which is 40. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When I did the three-digit numbers, I considered units place 4's as 39, but perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nSame approach. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49 units place 4's and 49 units place 8's. But that can't be, because when I did the detailed count earlier, I had more 4's than 8's. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, let me check. If I calculate the number of 4's in the units place as 49, and 8's as 49, then the difference would be zero, but that contradicts my earlier result. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check again.\n\nIn the first method, when I was counting 4's in the units place in three-digit numbers, I had 39, plus single-digit 1, which is 40. But according to this method, it's 49. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's think: from 1-9, units place 4 appears once (page4). From 10-99, units place 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94). From 100-488, units place 4 appears how many times? Well, for each hundred, 10 times (e.g., 104,114,...,194 in 100-199). So, 100-399:3*10=30. 400-488: how many times? 404,414,...,484. From 400-488, that's 9 times (since 484 is the last one). So, 30 +9=39. Plus single-digit 1, so total 40. But according to the other method, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method. Let me recount the units place 4's:\n\nFrom 1-9:1 (page4).\n\nFrom 10-99:9 (14,24,...,94).\n\nFrom 100-488: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 10 each, so 30. Plus 400-488:404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers. So total 30+9=39.\n\nSo, 1+9+39=49. Wait, that's 49. Earlier, I thought 1+19+168=188, but that was for all 4's in all places. So, perhaps I confused the counts.\n\nWait, I think I see the confusion. When I did the first method, I was adding up all the 4's in all digit places, but when I did the second method, I was only considering the units place. So, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the total number of 4's printed, regardless of the digit place, compared to the total number of 8's. So, I need to count all 4's in all digit places and all 8's in all digit places.\n\nSo, perhaps the second method is better. Let me try that.\n\nSo, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: As calculated, 49.\n\nNumber of 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1-488?\n\nFrom 1-9: tens place doesn't exist, so 0.\n\nFrom 10-99: numbers 40-49:10 times.\n\nFrom 100-488: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149:10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, and 400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488). So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nWait, but 400-488: the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10 (from 40-49) + 4*10=40 (from 100-488) =50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-9:0.\n\nFrom 10-99:80-89:10 times.\n\nFrom 100-488: In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, in 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's:10 +10 +10 +9=39.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:50, 8's:39.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488:89 numbers, each has 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: From 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, adding up all 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50=99 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:39\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49 +39=88.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -88=100.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 98 8's, but now I'm getting 88. Hmm, where's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, in the first method, I had 98 8's, but in this second method, I have 88. Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, I had:\n\nSingle-digit 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit 8's:19\n\nThree-digit 8's:78\n\nTotal:1+19=20+78=98.\n\nBut in the second method, I have:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:39\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:88.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 10. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first method, I overcounted the three-digit 8's. Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, I had three-digit 8's as 78, which was tens place 39 and units place 39. But according to the second method, it's 39 (tens) +49 (units) - wait, no, in the second method, units place is 49, but that's across all digit places. Wait, no, in the second method, units place 8's:49, tens place 8's:39, hundreds place:0, total 88.\n\nWait, but in the first method, I had:\n\nThree-digit 8's: tens place 39, units place 39, so 78. Plus single-digit 1 and two-digit 19, total 98.\n\nBut in the second method, I have:\n\nThree-digit 8's: tens place 39, units place 49, but that can't be because units place 49 includes single-digit and two-digit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the counts. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the second method, I calculated units place 8's as 49, which includes single-digit 8 (page8) and two-digit 8's in the units place (18,28,...,98). So, units place 8's:49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 8's:39, which includes two-digit 80-89 (10) and three-digit 180-189, etc. (30 +9=39).\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =88.\n\nBut in the first method, I had:\n\nSingle-digit 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit 8's:19 (tens 10 + units 9)\n\nThree-digit 8's:78 (tens 39 + units 39)\n\nTotal:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, the discrepancy is because in the second method, the units place 8's include both single-digit and two-digit, while in the first method, I separated them. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the second method, units place 8's:49 includes single-digit 8 (page8) and two-digit 8's in units place (18,28,...,98). So, 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) =49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 8's:39 includes two-digit 80-89 (10) and three-digit 180-189, etc. (30 +9=39).\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) =88.\n\nBut in the first method, I had:\n\nSingle-digit 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit 8's:19 (tens 10 + units 9)\n\nThree-digit 8's:78 (tens 39 + units 39)\n\nTotal:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, which is correct? The second method seems more accurate because it systematically counts each digit place without overlap. So, I think the correct total is 88 8's.\n\nBut wait, let's check the units place 8's again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 8's: every 100 numbers, 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). In each of the first three, 10 times, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So total 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=88.\n\nSo, the second method is correct, and the first method had an error. I think I overcounted the three-digit 8's in the first method by including some numbers that were already counted in the two-digit or single-digit counts.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:188, total 8's:88. The difference is 188 -88=100.\n\nWait, but earlier in the first method, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, but now it's 188 4's and 88 8's, so the difference is 100.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the 4's count again.\n\nIn the second method:\n\nUnits place 4's:49\n\nTens place 4's:50\n\nHundreds place 4's:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place 8's:49\n\nTens place 8's:39\n\nHundreds place 8's:0\n\nTotal 8's:88.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -88=100.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 90, but now it's 100. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the counts again.\n\nUnits place 4's:49\n\nTens place 4's:50\n\nHundreds place 4's:89\n\nTotal 4's:188.\n\nUnits place 8's:49\n\nTens place 8's:39\n\nHundreds place 8's:0\n\nTotal 8's:88.\n\nSo, 188-88=100.\n\nBut in the first method, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, which would be 90 difference. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first method, when I was counting three-digit 8's, I overcounted. Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, I had:\n\nThree-digit 8's: tens place 39, units place 39.\n\nBut according to the second method, units place 8's in three-digit numbers is 39, but in the first method, I had 39 in three-digit units place, plus 9 in two-digit units place, and 1 in single-digit. So, total 39+9+1=49, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the first method, I had three-digit 8's as 78, which was tens 39 and units 39, but that's incorrect because units place 39 in three-digit numbers plus units place 9 in two-digit numbers plus units place 1 in single-digit numbers equals 49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 39 in three-digit numbers plus tens place 10 in two-digit numbers plus tens place 0 in single-digit numbers equals 49, but wait, no, in two-digit numbers, tens place 8's are 10 (80-89), so total tens place 8's:10 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49, but in the second method, I had tens place 8's as 39. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, in the second method, I had:\n\nTens place 8's: from two-digit 10 (80-89) and three-digit 39 (180-189, etc.), so total 49. But earlier, in the second method, I thought tens place 8's were 39, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the second method, I had:\n\nTens place 8's: from two-digit 10 (80-8"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit page number with a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99): Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. The tens digit is 4, so the pages would be 40-49. That's 10 pages, each contributing one 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 4's. Now, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can be in the units place, so we have 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to be careful not to double count. Let me list them out: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, but 44 contributes an extra 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted. So, for the units place, it's 9 4's. Wait, no, actually, each of these numbers has one 4 in the units place except 44, which has two 4's. But I think I should count the number of 4's in the units place as 9, because each of these 9 numbers has one 4 there, regardless of the tens digit. So, in two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 4's. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm missing one? Because when I count 10 in the tens place (40-49) and 9 in the units place (14,24,...,94), 44 is included in both counts, so I'm actually counting two 4's for 44. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 + 9 = 19, which includes both the tens and units places. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). This is a bit more complex because we have three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. Let's break it down by each digit position.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the page numbers are from 400 to 488. I need to count how many 4's are in the hundreds place here. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, but I'm interested in when it's 4. Let's consider each hundred separately. From 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149, which is 10 pages. So, 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, from 200-299: 240-249, another 10 4's. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10 4's. From 400-488: The tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. However, since 488 is the last page, 449 is included, so that's 10 4's. So, in total, the tens place contributes 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 4's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. From 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-9, but the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 40 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred separately. From 100-199: The units digit is 4 for pages 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 pages, each contributing a 4 in the units place. Similarly, from 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 pages. From 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 pages. From 400-488: The units digit is 4 for pages 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 pages. Because 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484: that's 9 pages. So, for the units place in the hundreds 400-488, it's 9 4's. So, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see, starting at 404, then every 10 pages. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first and 484 is the last, with a difference of 80, so 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers: 10 per hundred, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 isn't a full hundred, but for the tens digit, it's still 10 pages where the tens digit is 4, as 440-449 is within 400-488. So, 10 per hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: 10 per hundred for the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 4's, so 30. Then, for 400-488, it's 9, as calculated. So, total units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit page number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99): The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's start with the tens place. The tens digit is 8, so the pages are 80-89. That's 10 pages, each contributing one 8 in the tens place, so that's 10 8's.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the 8 can be in the units place, so we have 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But 88 has two 8's, so I need to check if I'm counting correctly. When I count the units place, each of these 9 numbers has one 8 in the units place, so that's 9 8's. However, 88 is included in both the tens and units counts, so it's counted twice. But since I'm counting the number of 8's, each occurrence is counted separately. So, in the tens place, 88 contributes one 8, and in the units place, it contributes another 8. So, the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For the units place, from 10-99, the units digit is 8 for 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8, so 9 8's. The tens place is 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. So, total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). Again, let's break it down by each digit position.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 8, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 0-9. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 8 for pages 180-189, which is 10 pages. So, 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: Again, considering each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit is 8 for pages 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 pages, each contributing an 8 in the units place.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 pages.\n\nFrom 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 pages.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit is 8 for pages 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 pages because 408 is the first and 488 is the last, with a difference of 80, so 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nWait, that's the same as the tens place. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89) + units place 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19\n\nThree-digit: tens place 39 (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488) + units place 39 (108,118,...,198; 208,...,298; 308,...,398; 408,...,488) = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\n\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the three-digit numbers, I had 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. Then, adding single-digit 1 and two-digit 19, total 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, when I counted the units place for 4's, I had 39. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 100-199: units digit 4 appears 10 times (104,114,...,194)\n\nFrom 200-299: 10 times\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 times\n\nFrom 400-488: 404,414,...,484: that's 9 times.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTens place for 4's: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449). Wait, wait, in the three-digit numbers, for the tens place, I considered each hundred separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, for each of these, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, except for 400-488, which is only 10 times as well because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, 4 times 10 = 40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The book has 488 pages, so the last page is 488. Did I account for that correctly? For example, in the units place for 4's in 400-488, I counted 9 numbers: 404,414,...,484. Let me check: 404 is the first, then adding 10 each time: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place in 400-488: 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I counted the 4's in the three-digit numbers, I included 400-488, which is correct, but let me check if I included all the 4's correctly.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 10 per hundred: 4 times 10 = 40.\n\nIn the units place, 10 per hundred for the first three hundreds, and 9 for the last. So, 39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168.\n\nAdding single-digit 1 and two-digit 19: 1+19=20. 20+168=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78: 1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: From 1 to 9, only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 each have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 occurrences (40, 41, ..., 49). \n\nFor the units place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 each have a 4 in the units place. That's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I'm counting correctly. In the units place, each of these numbers contributes one 4, regardless of the tens digit, except that 44 is already counted in the tens place. So actually, for the units place, it's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 is included in both the tens and units counts, so I have to be careful not to double-count. Hmm, but in reality, when I count the tens place, I include 40-49, which includes 44, and when I count the units place, I include 14,24,...,94, which also includes 44. So 44 is counted twice. But in reality, the digit 4 appears twice in 44, so it's correct to count it twice. So, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Wait, but 44 is in both, so maybe I should check. Let me list them:\n\nTens place: 40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49: 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place.\n\nBut 44 is in both lists, so it's counted twice, which is correct because it has two 4's. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These range from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. However, since the book ends at 488, the last range is only up to 449. So, for each hundred except the last one, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149). For the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10\n\nSo that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40.\n\nNow, units place: Similarly, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,124,...,194 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 204,214,...,294 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 304,314,...,394 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, how many is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10. Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 404 to 484 is 9 steps: 404 (1), 414 (2), ..., 484 (9). So that's 9 occurrences. Therefore, for the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488 for units digit 4. The numbers would be 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So yes, 9.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. Yes.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: From 1 to 9, only page 8 has an 8. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Again, tens and units place.\n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89 have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8. So 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The numbers 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 have an 8 in the units place. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. However, 88 has two 8's, so when counting units place, 88 is included, but since we're only counting units place here, it's just one occurrence. Wait, no, the units place count is per number, regardless of the tens digit. So, for units place, it's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. So 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 is in both tens and units place counts. So, similar to the 4's, 88 is counted twice, once in tens and once in units. Which is correct because it has two 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTens place: Similar to the 4's, we need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for each hundred except the last one, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. For the last hundred, it's 9 times.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,128,...,198 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count these: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but the next would be 498, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, units place 8's:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488 for units digit 8. The numbers would be 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. Yes.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, checking 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Wait, but earlier I thought 44 is included in both, so 19 is correct because 44 contributes two 4's, so 10 + 9 = 19, which counts both 4's in 44. So that's correct.\n\nThree-digit 4's:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40 occurrences (10 per hundred for 4 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 in each hundred, but in the hundreds 1,2,3,4. Wait, no, in the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, etc., which is 10 numbers per hundred. So 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, so in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 40 total.\n\nUnits place: 39. Wait, but 400-488: units digit 4 appears 9 times, as we have 404,414,...,484. So 9, plus 10 each in the first three hundreds: 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, total 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Correct, as 88 contributes two 8's.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 10 per hundred for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 for 400-488, total 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 per hundred for first three, and 9 for 400-488, total 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, total 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Did I count correctly in three-digit numbers for 4's and 8's? Let me check the three-digit 4's again.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So 4 sets of 10, total 40. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, 10 numbers where units digit is 4. So 100-199:104,114,...,194 (10), 200-299:204,...,294 (10), 300-399:304,...,394 (10), and 400-488:404,414,...,484 (9). So total 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 10 per hundred for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 for 400-488 (480-488). So 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 10 per hundred for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 for 400-488 (408,418,...,488). So 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. Plus single and two-digit:1+19=20, total 98. Correct.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is page 4. So that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. So, I'll consider both positions separately.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but since we're counting each occurrence, it's still one 4 in the units place. So, from 10 to 99, the units place has 4's in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 44 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place. So, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, so does that mean we're double-counting it? No, because each digit is counted separately. So, yes, 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits can only go up to 88 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's handle this carefully.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- From 100 to 199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n- From 200 to 299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10.\n- From 300 to 399: 340-349, another 10.\n- From 400 to 488: Here, the tens digit can be 4, but the hundreds digit is 4, and the units digit can go from 0 to 88. So, 440-449 would be 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fine because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. So, total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place.\n200-299: 240-249: 10.\n300-399: 340-349: 10.\n400-488: 440-449: 10.\nSo, yes, 10 each, totaling 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n- 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. There are 10 tens, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 10.\n- 300-399: 10.\n- 400-488: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the units place here? From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, there's one 4. How many tens are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, which is 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8 in the last ten. So, in each ten, there's one 4 in the units place, except maybe the last ten if it doesn't complete.\n\nWait, let's see: from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. How many complete tens are there? From 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 480-488, the units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, in each ten from 400-480, each has one 4 in the units place. There are 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), but 480-488 is incomplete. However, in each of the first 8 tens (400-409 up to 470-479), there are 10 units digits, so each has one 4. The 9th ten is 480-488, which has units digits 0-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nSo, total for 400-488 in units place: 8 tens with 10 numbers each (400-409 to 470-479) contributing 8 occurrences, plus 1 in 480-488, totaling 9.\n\nWait, but wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, regardless of whether it's complete or not, the units digit 4 occurs once. So, how many tens are there? From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, that's 9 tens. Each ten has one occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 9 in 400-488, but adding up, it's 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, the units place in three-digit numbers contributes 39 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds, tens, and units are separate. So, the hundreds place contributes 89, the tens place 40, and the units place 39. So, total for three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nThen, total 4's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Wait, single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 168. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers ending with 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, but we're counting each occurrence. So, in the units place, it's 9 occurrences, including 88. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nBreaking it down by hundreds:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 8 for 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10.\n- 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n- 100-199: For each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each ten, there's one 8. There are 10 tens, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 10.\n- 300-399: 10.\n- 400-488: For each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9, but the last ten is 480-488, which has units digits 0-8. So, in each ten, there's one 8. How many tens are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens. Each ten contributes one 8 in the units place, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, the units place contributes 39 occurrences of 8.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78.\n\nWait, but wait: three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units. We've already accounted for hundreds place as 0. So, tens place is 39 and units place is 39, so total for three-digit numbers is 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, total 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts. For the tens place, we had 10+10+10+9=39, and units place 10+10+10+9=39, so 39+39=78. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens: 40-49: 10\n- Units: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9\nTotal two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89\n- Tens: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 10 each, so 40\n- Units: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10, and 400-488 has 9: 10+10+10+9=39\nTotal three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens: 80-89: 10\n- Units: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 9\nTotal two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19\nThree-digit:\n- Tens: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 10,10,10,9=39\n- Units: 100-199,200-299,300-399 each have 10, and 400-488 has 9: 10+10+10+9=39\nTotal three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFor three-digit units place of 4's:\n\n100-199: 10 (104,114,...,194)\n200-299: 10\n300-399:10\n400-488: How many? From 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs once in each ten. So, from 400-409:404, 410-419:414, ..., up to 480-488:484. How many tens are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens. Each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit units place: same logic, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I counted the three-digit numbers for 4's in the hundreds place, I said from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, there are none because the book ends at 488, so no pages from 800-899.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nThus, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10, 10, 10, and 10 respectively \u2192 40.\n     - Units place: Each hundred contributes 10, 10, 10, and 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: None, as pages don't reach 800.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10, 10, 10, and 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: Each hundred contributes 10, 10, 10, and 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages: From 1 to 9, the only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. \n\nNow, moving on to two-digit pages: These are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the ones place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. \n\nFor the ones place: The numbers where the ones digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I don't double count. However, since I'm just counting the number of times 4 appears, each occurrence counts separately. So, starting from 14, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the ones place. From 10 to 99, that's 9 times (14,24,...,94). So, 9 fours in the ones place. \n\nAdding these together for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 fours. \n\nSo, for single and two-digit pages, the total number of 4's is 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 fours. \n\nNow, onto three-digit pages: From 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and ones places. Again, I'll need to count the number of 4's in each place. \n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and ones digits can only go up to 88 (since 488 is the last page). \n\nSo, hundreds place: For numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each of these, the tens digit can be 4, and the ones digit can be anything from 0-9. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 numbers = 30 fours. \n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 4, but the ones digit can only go up to 8 (since the last page is 488). So, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 440 to 448, that's 9 numbers (440, 441, ..., 448). So, 9 fours. \n\nAdding these together, the tens place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 fours. \n\nNow, ones place: Counting how many times 4 appears in the ones place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each hundred, the ones digit can be 4, and the tens digit can be anything from 0-9. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the ones digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; similarly for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 numbers = 30 fours. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The ones digit can be 4, and the tens digit can be from 0-8 (since the last page is 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a number ending with 4: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 fours. \n\nAdding these together, the ones place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 fours. \n\nNow, total number of 4's in three-digit pages: hundreds (89) + tens (39) + ones (39) = 167 fours. \n\nAdding this to the single and two-digit pages, total 4's in the entire book: 20 (from 1-99) + 167 (from 100-488) = 187 fours. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. From 1-99, we had 20 fours, and from 100-488, we have 167 fours, so total is indeed 20 + 167 = 187 fours. \n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do a similar process. \n\nSingle-digit pages: From 1-9, the only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's one 8. \n\nTwo-digit pages: From 10-99. Again, count 8's in tens and ones places. \n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights. \n\nOnes place: Numbers where the ones digit is 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Again, 88 has two 8's, but we're counting each occurrence. So, from 10-99, every 10 numbers, there's an 8 in the ones place. That's 9 numbers (18,28,...,98). So, 9 eights in the ones place. \n\nAdding together for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 eights. \n\nSo, for single and two-digit pages, total eights are 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 eights. \n\nNow, three-digit pages: From 100-488. Again, hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and ones digits are limited. \n\nFirst, hundreds place: For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the hundreds digit is not 8, so no eights here. For hundreds digit 4, as before, the hundreds place is 4, not 8, so no eights in the hundreds place across any three-digit pages. So, total eights in hundreds place: 0. \n\nTens place: Now, counting eights in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100-488. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, 4: For each hundred, the tens digit can be 8, and the ones digit can be anything from 0-9, except when the hundreds digit is 4, where the ones digit is limited to 0-8. \n\nWait, let me clarify. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: The tens digit can be 8, and the ones digit can be 0-9, so 10 numbers each. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 numbers = 30 eights. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 8, but the ones digit can only go up to 8 (since the last page is 488). So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights. \n\nAdding these together, the tens place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 eights. \n\nNow, ones place: Counting eights in the ones place across all three-digit numbers from 100-488. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each hundred, the ones digit can be 8, and the tens digit can be anything from 0-9. So, for each hundred, 10 numbers where the ones digit is 8 (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198; similarly for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 numbers = 30 eights. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The ones digit can be 8, and the tens digit can be from 0-8 (since the last page is 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a number ending with 8: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights. \n\nAdding these together, the ones place contributes 30 + 9 = 39 eights. \n\nNow, total number of 8's in three-digit pages: tens (39) + ones (39) = 78 eights. \n\nAdding this to the single and two-digit pages, total 8's in the entire book: 20 (from 1-99) + 78 (from 100-488) = 98 eights. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-99, we had 20 eights, and from 100-488, we have 78 eights, so total is indeed 20 + 78 = 98 eights. \n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 187 fours - 98 eights = 89. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with 4's: \n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place (40-49: 10 fours) + ones place (14,24,...,94: 9 fours) = 19. So, total 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place (400-488: 89 fours). \n\nTens place: hundreds 1,2,3 each have 10 numbers with 4 in tens place (140-149, etc.), so 30. For hundreds 4, tens place 4: 440-448, which is 9 fours. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nOnes place: hundreds 1,2,3 each have 10 numbers with 4 in ones place (104,114,...), so 30. For hundreds 4, ones place 4: 404,414,...,484, which is 9 fours. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nTotal three-digit fours: 89 + 39 + 39 = 167. \n\nTotal fours: 20 + 167 = 187. That seems correct. \n\nNow for 8's: \n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place (80-89: 10 eights) + ones place (18,28,...,98: 9 eights) = 19. So, total 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nThree-digit: \n\nTens place: hundreds 1,2,3 each have 10 numbers with 8 in tens place (180-189, etc.), so 30. For hundreds 4, tens place 8: 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nOnes place: hundreds 1,2,3 each have 10 numbers with 8 in ones place (108,118,...), so 30. For hundreds 4, ones place 8: 408,418,...,488, which is 9 eights. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nTotal three-digit eights: 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nTotal eights: 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nSo, 187 fours - 98 eights = 89. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for three-digit numbers? For example, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But when counting 8's, the hundreds digit is never 8, so that's correct. \n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 30 (from 100-399) plus 9 (from 400-488), totaling 39. Similarly for ones place, same logic. \n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. Same for ones place, 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. \n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nBut wait, let me think about page 488. When counting the ones place for 8's in three-digit numbers, I included 488, which is correct. Similarly, when counting 4's in the hundreds place, 488 is included as it's part of 400-488. \n\nI think the counts are accurate. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, there's 1 occurrence of the digit 4 in the single-digit pages.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49.

So, total 4's in two-digit pages: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. I need to count the number of 4's in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: The tens digit can be 4 in any of these. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). There are 3 hundreds, so 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 4, but we have to consider up to 488. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: Again, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The units digit can be 4 from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let me check: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers. So, starting at 404, 414, ..., up to 484. How many is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10: (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for the hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 would be 9, so adding to the 30 from 100-399 gives 39.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For each hundred (1-3), the units digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 3*10=30. For 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let's see, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, yes, 9. So total units place 4's: 30+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89+40=129, 129+39=168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit: 89+40+39=168. So 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do a similar breakdown.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Count 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers ending with 8 from 10 to 99. These are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers. But 88 has an 8 in both tens and units, so we count each occurrence separately. So, 9 occurrences in units place.\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit pages: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: From 100 to 488. Let's count 8's in hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit from 100 to 488.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: For each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.), except for the last hundred (400-488), where the tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, but only up to 488.\n\nWait, let me break it down:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has a full set of tens digits, so for each, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times. So, 3 hundreds *10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo total tens place 8's:30+9=39.\n\nUnits place: Now, count how many times 8 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 8 (e.g., 108,118,...,198; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds *10=30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:30+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39) =78\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78. So, 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10, units place 14,24,...,94:9, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1-3:10 each, so 30; for 400-488:440-449:10, so total 40.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1-3:10 each, so 30; for 400-488:404,414,...,484:9, so total 39.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+89+40+39=188. Wait, no, that's incorrect because I think I added the three-digit counts again. Wait, no, the three-digit counts were 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168. Then, adding single and two-digit:1+19=20, so total 168+20=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:80-89:10, units place 18,28,...,98:9, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: hundreds 1-3:10 each, so 30; hundreds 4:480-488:9, total 39.\n\nUnits place: hundreds 1-3:10 each, so 30; hundreds 4:408,418,...,488:9, total 39.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit counts, especially for the units and tens places. Let me double-check.\n\nFor three-digit 4's:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each has a 4 in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149). So, 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449:10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:30+10=40.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where units digit is 4 (e.g., 104,114,...,194). So, 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4, units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's see: starting at 404, each 10 numbers. From 404 to 484, that's (484-404)/10 +1=8+1=9 numbers. So, 9.\n\nTotal units place 4's:30+9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, total 168+20=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place:0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189). So, 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:30+9=39.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where units digit is 8 (e.g., 108,118,...,198). So, 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4, units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488. How many? Let's count:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:30+9=39.\n\nThus, three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, total 78+20=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the units place for three-digit numbers. For hundreds 4, units digit 8: starting at 408, each 10 numbers up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit in hundreds 4, 480-488:9 numbers, correct.\n\nI think the counts are accurate. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nNext, two-digit pages (10-99): Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's break it down:\n\n- Tens place: The numbers 40-49 have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n- Units place: For the units place, every 10 numbers (like 14, 24, 34, etc.) have a 4. From 10-99, how many such numbers are there? Well, it's 9 sets of 10 (10-99) but starting from 10, so 9 occurrences? Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so for the units place, from 10-99, excluding 40-49, how many 4's are there? Hmm, maybe I should consider all two-digit numbers and then subtract the overlap. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate each separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately, without worrying about overlap because when you add them, you might be double-counting some numbers, but in reality, each occurrence is a separate digit. So, for two-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Units place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), there's exactly one number ending with 4. So that's 9 groups, each contributing 1, so 9 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but wait, 40-49 includes 44, which has two 4's, but when we count tens and units separately, we're correctly counting each digit. So, 40-49: 10 4's in the tens place, and for the units place, from 10-99, each ten's group has one 4, so 9 in total. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages (100-488). Here, each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. Let's break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's see:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 4: Pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's consider the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 pages. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these groups has 100 pages. In each, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times (once every 10 pages). So, in each group, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, for each of these hundreds groups, that's 10 4's in the tens place. Since there are three such groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 4's.\n\n- Now, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds groups.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each group has 100 pages. In each, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each group, the units digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 groups * 10 = 30 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group. The last page is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last group (480-488). So, in 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? It would be once per ten's group: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so only up to 484. Let's count how many: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400 to 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., up to 484. How many is that? Let's see: from 404 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So, 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. For 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. So total 40. That seems correct.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 4's, so 30. For 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times (as calculated). So total 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then adding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: Numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- Units place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), there's exactly one number ending with 8. So, 9 groups, each contributing 1, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3,4:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 100 pages. In each, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each group, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, for each of these three groups, that's 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 pages. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds groups:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each group has 100 pages. In each, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each group, the units digit is 8 exactly 10 times (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 groups * 10 = 30 8's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group. The last page is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last group (480-488). So, in 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? It would be once per ten's group: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Three-digit 8's: tens place is 39, units place is 39, so 39 + 39 = 78. Then, single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, and three-digit 8's are 78, so total 20 + 78 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 4's and 98 8's. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 4's.\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. Wait, that's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So, total 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 4's.\n- Tens place: For 100-399: 3 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 3*10=30. For 400-488: 440-449: 10 4's. So, 30 +10=40.\n- Units place: For 100-399: 3 groups, each contributing 10 4's: 3*10=30. For 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: 9 numbers. So, 30 +9=39.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +89+40+39= 1+19=20, 89+40=129, 129+39=168. 20+168=188. So, correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10 8's.\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total 10 +9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since hundreds digits go up to 4.\n- Tens place: For 100-399: 3 groups, each contributing 10 8's: 3*10=30. For 400-488: 480-488: 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 30 +9=39.\n- Units place: For 100-399: 3 groups, each contributing 10 8's: 3*10=30. For 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 numbers. So, 30 +9=39.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 +19 +39+39= 1+19=20, 39+39=78. 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might not be right. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, units place 4's:\n\n- 100-399: Each hundred has 10 units 4's, so 3*10=30.\n- 400-488: Units 4's are 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 units 4's.\n\nSo, 30+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=39.\n- Units place:30 (from 100-399)+9 (from 400-488)=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. Plus single and two-digit:20, total 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits from 1 to 488.\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 numbers, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 \u00f710=48 complete blocks, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, total units 4's:48*1=48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which is a 4. So, units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's:48*1=48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has a units digit 8. So, units 8's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Wait, earlier I had 39 units 4's in three-digit numbers, plus 9 in two-digit, plus 1 in single-digit, totaling 49. Similarly, for 8's, units place:39 in three-digit, 9 in two-digit, 1 in single-digit, totaling 49. So that matches.\n\nWait, but in my earlier detailed count, I had 39 units 4's in three-digit, 9 in two-digit, and 1 in single-digit, which adds up to 49. Similarly for 8's:39 units in three-digit, 9 in two-digit, 1 in single-digit, totaling 49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place per hundred. So, for 488 numbers, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400), and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, and similarly 4*10=40 for 8.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred (401-488):\n\nThe tens digits here go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n\nTotal tens 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but in my earlier detailed count, I had:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\n- Two-digit numbers:10 (40-49).\n- Three-digit numbers:30 (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488)=40.\nSo, total 10+40=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\n- Two-digit numbers:10 (80-89).\n- Three-digit numbers:30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=39.\nSo, total 10+39=49.\n\nSo, that matches the alternative method.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: no hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total hundreds 4's:89.\n\nTotal hundreds 8's:0.\n\nNow, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The 4 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, in the range 10-99, the numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 is already counted in the tens place, so in the units place, it's 8 more occurrences? No, actually, each occurrence is counted separately, even if the number has both digits as 4. So, in the units place, from 10-99, the 4 appears 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). Wait, but 44 is included in both counts, but that's okay because each digit is counted separately. So, in the units place, it's 9 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nWait, let me check: from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10. Then, in the units place, starting from 14, every 10 numbers, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So total 10+9=19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, numbers from 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many 4's are there? The numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. In 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) = 40. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, 204,214,...,294: 10. In 300-399: 304,...,394: 10. In 400-488: 404,414,...,484. Now, how many is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488. So, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 404, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, yes, 9. So, total units place 4's: 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nWait, but wait: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. Again, tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers ending with 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place doesn't occur because the hundreds digits are only 1,2,3,4. So, 0 occurrences in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in the range X80-X89. So, in 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299:280-289, 10. 300-399:380-389,10. 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, how many numbers? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place:\n\n100-199:10\n200-299:10\n300-399:10\n400-488:9\nTotal tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199:108,118,...,198:10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299:208,...,298:10. 300-399:308,...,398:10. 400-488:408,418,...,488. Now, how many is that? From 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 =78.\n\nWait, but let me check: hundreds place is 0, tens is 39, units is 39, so total 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit 4's count. Let me check again.\n\nIn the hundreds place for three-digit numbers:400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place: for each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each except for 400-488, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 10 each, so 4 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is the fourth hundred, but it's only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10. So, 10*4=40.\n\nUnits place: for each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs 10 times except for the last hundred, 400-488. Wait, in 100-199, units digit 4 occurs at 104,114,...,194:10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:404,414,...,484. How many is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, units place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: for each hundred, 10 numbers except the last hundred, where it's 9 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: for each hundred, 10 except the last, which is 9 (408,418,...,488). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the last hundred for 8's in units place would have 9, but let me check: from 408 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9. So, 39 in units place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, tens place:39.\n\nSo, total 78. So, yes, 98 total 8's.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or something, but I think the way I did it is thorough enough. I considered each digit place separately for each range of page numbers, which should cover all possibilities without missing any. So, I'm confident that the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - Units place: 14, 24, ..., 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 occurrences \u2192 40.\n   - Units place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, except 400-488, which has 9 \u2192 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n4. **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - Units place: 18, 28, ..., 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: No occurrences (hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4).\n   - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences, and 400-488 has 9 \u2192 39.\n   - Units place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, except 400-488, which has 9 \u2192 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n4. **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me consider the tens place first. The tens digit can be 4, which would be the numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences. Now, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I count both digits. So, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? There are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, etc.), and in each decade, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears once per decade. That's 9 times, but wait, from 10-99, that's 9 decades, so 9 times. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so in the units place, it's 9 occurrences, but in the tens place, it's 10 occurrences (40-49). So, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. From 10-99, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49), contributing 10 4's. The units digit is 4 for each number where the units digit is 4, which is once per ten, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So that's 9 4's in the units place. But 44 has both a tens and a units digit as 4, so in total, that's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. But wait, 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. Let me break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. So, for the hundreds digit, 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, in each hundred (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). But since our upper limit is 488, we need to check if the hundreds digit affects this. Let's consider each hundred separately:\n\n- 100-199: Tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, but since we go up to 488, 440-449 is 10 numbers (440-449), but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, 124, ..., 194 in 100-199). But since our upper limit is 488, let's check:\n\n- 100-199: 10 numbers where units digit is 4 (104, 114, ..., 194).\n- 200-299: Similarly, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: The units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, in 400-488, there are 9 numbers where the units digit is 4. Therefore, total units digit 4's: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 units digit 4's, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 30+9=39 units digit 4's.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the two-digit numbers. Earlier, I thought two-digit numbers had 19 4's, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place: 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. But 44 has two 4's, so in the units place, it's 9 4's, but in the tens place, it's 10 4's, so total 19 4's. So that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place: 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, it's 9 8's, and in the tens place, it's 10 8's, so total 19 8's.\n\nWait, but 88 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. So, the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 can't be in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). Let's check each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 78.\n\nWait, but let me add that: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, for the tens place of 8's, I had 39, and units place 39, totaling 78. Then adding single-digit 1 and two-digit 19, total 98. That seems correct.\n\nFor 4's, I had 1 single-digit, 19 two-digit, and 168 three-digit, totaling 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just verify the three-digit counts again because that's where most of the digits are.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place 4's: In each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. So, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place 4's: In each hundred, 10 numbers where units digit is 4, except in 400-488, which has 9. So, 3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 +39=168. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: In each of the first three hundreds, 10 numbers, and in 400-488, 9 numbers, so 3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, 3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1+19=20, plus 168=188.\n\n8's:1+19=20, plus 78=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's one 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. So, I should count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the ones place separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor the ones place: The 4's appear in the ones place every 10 numbers. So, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, the last one is 94. Let me count: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the ones place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which range from 100 to 488. Again, I'll need to consider the hundreds, tens, and ones places separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds digit being 4, the numbers from 400 to 488 will have a 4 in the hundreds place. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's a 4. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). But since the last hundred only goes up to 488, I need to check if 480-488 affects this. \n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers: Similar to the tens place, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the ones digit is 4 once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, that's 10 4's (e.g., 104, 114, 124, ..., 194; similarly for 200-299, etc.), but again, the last hundred might be cut short.\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred has 10 4's in the ones place, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nFrom 400-488: The ones digit is 4 for 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Let me count: starting at 404, adding 10 each time, up to 484. That's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 4's.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the ones place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nAdding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. Then, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, 20 + 168 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Again, I'll count 8's in the tens and ones places.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80 to 89 have an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: The 8's appear every 10 numbers, starting from 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: Now, let's consider the hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nTens place: Let's look at each hundred:\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 8 for 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 280-289, another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nOnes place: The ones digit is 8 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, let's count:\n\nFrom 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: starting at 408, adding 10 each time up to 488. That's (488 - 408)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in the ones place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. Then, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. So, 20 + 78 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19\n\nThree-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19\n\nThree-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me think if I might have double-counted somewhere or missed a range.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers for 4's in the tens place, I considered 100-399 as 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488 adds another 10 (440-449), so total 40. That seems correct.\n\nIn the ones place for three-digit 4's, 100-399 gives 3\u00d710=30, and 400-488 gives 9 (404, 414,...484). So, 30+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 100-399 gives 3\u00d710=30, and 400-488 gives 9 (480-488), so 30+9=39.\n\nIn the ones place, 100-399 gives 3\u00d710=30, and 400-488 gives 9 (408,418,...488), so 30+9=39.\n\nSo, adding up correctly. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. Only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: In the range 10-99, every 10 numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) will have exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten, but wait, starting from 10, the first set is 10-19, which has 14, then 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, that's actually 9 occurrences, right? Because from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99). Each decade has one number ending with 4, so 9 times. But wait, 44 is counted in both the tens and units place. So, when I count the tens place as 10 (40-49), and the units place as 9 (14,24,...,94), the total for two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, so does that mean I'm double-counting it? Hmm, actually, no. Because in the tens place count, 44 is one of the 10, and in the units place count, it's one of the 9. So, the total is correct as 19, with 44 being counted twice because it has two 4's. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 19.\n\nNow, let's move on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, but for 4, it only goes up to 488, not 499. So, let's break this down.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 1: The hundreds place is 1, so numbers from 100 to 199. How many 4's are there in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 2: Similarly, numbers from 200 to 299. Hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here. 0 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 3: Numbers from 300 to 399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's here. 0 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 4: Numbers from 400 to 488. Now, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nFor the tens place, each ten's group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.) will have a sequence where the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1: The tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 2: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 numbers. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 3: 340-349, another 10. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 4: Now, we need to be careful here because the book ends at 488. So, the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers would be 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, yes, 40 in total.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the units digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 104,114,...,194 in 100-199). \n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1: From 100-199, the units digit is 4 for 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 2: Similarly, 204,214,...,294. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 3: 304,314,...,394. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 4: Now, from 400-488, the units digit is 4 for numbers like 404,414,...,484. How many are there? Let's see, starting from 404, each 10 numbers, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488, so yes, only 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4: starting at 404, adding 10 each time: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 +10 = 494 > 488. So yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units digit occurrences in three-digit numbers: 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 occurrences.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. Okay.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in the entire book:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 occurrences.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Correct.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's in all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. Only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nTens place: Numbers where the tens digit is 8, which are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: In each decade (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit is 8 once. So, from 10-99, that's 9 decades, each contributing one 8. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 is included in both counts: tens place (80-89) and units place (18,28,...,88). So, when I count 10 in the tens and 9 in the units, the total is 19, but 88 is counted twice, so the actual number of 8's is 19, but that includes two 8's in 88. So, the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 19.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The tens place count is 10 (80-89), each having an 8 in the tens place. The units place count is 9 (18,28,...,88). So, the total is 10 + 9 = 19, but 88 is counted in both, so the total number of 8's is 19, but the actual count of digits is 19, because each occurrence is a digit, even if it's in the same number. So, 88 contributes two 8's, so the total is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 digits, which includes two 8's in 88. So, yes, the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, considering hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, let's see when the hundreds digit is 8. Wait, no, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, there are no three-digit page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, in the tens digit, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1: 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 2: 280-289. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 3: 380-389. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 4: Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds digit 4 would be from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1: From 100-199, the units digit is 8 for 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 2: 208,218,...,298. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 3: 308,318,...,398. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 4: From 400-488, the units digit is 8 for 408,418,...,488. Let's count how many: starting at 408, each 10 numbers. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For the tens place, I had 39, and for the units place, 39, so total 78. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers where both tens and units digits are 8, like 188, 288, etc. But in the counts above, each occurrence is counted separately for tens and units, so 188 would be counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, which is correct because it has two 8's. So, the total is indeed 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in the entire book:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 occurrences.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers for 4's. I had 89 in the hundreds place, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Then, in the tens place, I had 40, which is 10 for each hundred (1,2,3,4) so 10*4=40. Wait, but in the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 goes up to 449, but the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within the limit, so that's 10 numbers, correct. So, 40 is correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's in three-digit numbers, I had 39. That's because for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10, and for 4, it's 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit numbers, tens place: 10 for each of 1,2,3, and 9 for 4, totaling 39. Units place: same logic, 39. So, 78 total in three-digit, plus 19 in two-digit, plus 1 in single-digit, totaling 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4. So that's 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nNext, two-digit pages (10-99): Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. The tens digit can be 4, so numbers like 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 occurrences. Now, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the units digit can be 4. So, for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's a 4 in the units place. How many tens are there? From 10 to 99, that's 9 tens. But wait, in each ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences. But wait, the two-digit numbers go up to 99, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, 9 times 1, which is 9. So, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages (100-488). This is a bit more complex. Let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds digit being 4, we have numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 4 in any hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit being 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). But wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so let's check if the tens digit can be 4 there. From 400 to 488, the tens digit can be 0 to 8, so 4 is included. So, for each hundred except the last one, which is only up to 488, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is 10. But wait, let's count each hundred separately.\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10.\n- For 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n- For 400-488: The tens digit can be 4, but we have to check how many numbers are there. From 400-488, when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0-9, but since 488 is the last page, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8. Wait, but we're looking for when the tens digit is 4, so that's 440-449. That's 10 numbers (440 to 449). So, 10 occurrences here as well.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 includes 440-449 as a complete set of 10. So, in each hundred, the tens digit being 4 contributes 10 occurrences. So, for three-digit numbers, the tens digit being 4 contributes 10 (for 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: The units digit can be 4 in any number, regardless of the hundreds and tens digits. Let's think about how many times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 exactly once every ten numbers. So, for each hundred, how many times does the units digit 4 appear?\n\n- 100-199: There are 100 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194).\n- Similarly, 200-299: 10 times.\n- 300-399: 10 times.\n- 400-488: Here, the last number is 488, so how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit cycles every ten. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, 9 times? Wait, no, wait: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, because 484 is the 9th occurrence. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so how many complete tens are there? Let's see, 400-488: the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of times the units digit is 4 is floor((488 - 400)/10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 - 400 = 88, so 88/10 = 8.8, so 8 full tens, and then 8 more. Wait, maybe a better way is to consider that in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 0-88. So, for 0-88, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 9 times (4,14,24,...,84). Wait, 84 is the last one before 88. So, 9 times. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the units digit 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the units digit 4 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188. Hmm, seems high, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 8, so numbers from 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit can be 8. So, for each ten, that's one occurrence. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, two-digit numbers contribute 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 8.\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 only appears in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 8 in any hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 of each hundred. Let's check each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 8, so numbers from 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: The units digit can be 8 in any number. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers.\n\n- 100-199: 104, 114, ..., 194? Wait, no, units digit 8 would be 108, 118, ..., 198. That's 10 occurrences (from 108 to 198, step 10).\n- Similarly, 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: The units digit 8 would be 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units digit 8 in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:39+39=78, so total 1+19=20, 20+78=98. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit: tens (10) + units (9) =19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39)=168\nTotal:1+19+168=188\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit: tens (10) + units (9)=19\n- Three-digit: tens (39) + units (39)=78\nTotal:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Here, I need to count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place and the ones place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor the ones place: In every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). Each set has one 4 in the ones place, so that's 9 4's.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex. I need to consider hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, let's break it down by hundreds. The three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since 488 is the last page, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and ones digits are limited to 0-8 and 0-8 respectively.\n\nI'll handle each digit place separately.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's think about this. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, and 3: Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's.\n\nFor the 400-488 range: The tens digit can be 0-8, so 4 is included. So, from 440-449, that's 10 numbers. So, another 10 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 4's in the tens place for the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but hold on. When the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 0-8, which includes 4, so 10 numbers as I thought. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, ones place: Counting how many times 4 appears in the ones place for three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Again, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the ones digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; similarly for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's.\n\nFor the 400-488 range: The ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (0-8), there's a number ending with 4. So, 9 tens digits (0-8) \u00d7 1 (for the 4 in ones place) = 9 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, when the tens digit is 8, the ones digit can only go up to 8. So, in the 480s, the ones digits go from 0-8, so 484 is included, but 489 isn't because the book ends at 488. So, yes, in the 480s, we have 484 as the only number ending with 4. So, that's 1 number. Wait, but earlier I thought it's 9, but that might not be correct.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For the 400-488 range, the ones digit is 4 when the number is x4, where x is the tens digit. The tens digit can be 0-8, so for each tens digit, there's one number ending with 4. So, from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. So, 9 4's in the ones place for the 400-488 range.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the ones place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 30 + 9 = 39, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 numbers where the ones digit is 4, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, for 400-488, the ones digit is 4 in 9 numbers (as above). So, 30+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + ones place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me add them again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129; 129 + 39 (ones) = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, single-digit: 1 (only 4)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place: 10 (40-49), ones place: 9 (14,24,...,94) \u2192 10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 3\u00d710=30. For 400-488, tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total tens place 4's: 30+10=40.\n\nOnes place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers with ones digit 4, so 3\u00d710=30. For 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs in 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers (since tens digit goes from 0 to 8). So, 9. So, total ones place 4's: 30+9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. Only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: In each set of ten (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the ones digit is 8 once. So, 9 sets (10-19 up to 90-99) \u00d71=9 8's.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) +9 (ones)=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nFor hundreds 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 3\u00d710=30.\n\nFor the 400-488 range: The tens digit can be 0-8, so 8 is included. So, 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place for the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (including 480 and 488). So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=39.\n\nOnes place: Now, counting 8's in the ones place for three-digit numbers.\n\nFor hundreds 1,2,3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the ones digit is 8 (e.g., 108,118,...,198; similarly for 200s and 300s). So, 3\u00d710=30.\n\nFor the 400-488 range: The ones digit is 8 in numbers like 408,418,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The tens digit can be 0-8, so for each tens digit, there's a number ending with 8. So, from 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers (since tens digit goes from 0 to 8). So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total ones place 8's: 30 +9=39.\n\nWait, but let me check: For the 400-488 range, the ones digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + ones place (39)=78.\n\nWait, but let me add up the three-digit 8's again. Tens place:39, ones place:39. So, 39+39=78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's=1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's=188, total 8's=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (ones)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTens:40\n\nOnes:39\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (ones)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens:39\n\nOnes:39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4 has a 4.\n   - Total 4's: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 have a 4 in the tens place, totaling 10.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, ..., 94 have a 4 in the units place, totaling 9.\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - For hundreds 100-399, each hundred has 10 pages with a 4 in the tens place, totaling 3\u00d710=30.\n     - For 400-488, pages 440-449 have a 4 in the tens place, totaling 10.\n     - Total: 30 + 10 = 40\n   - **Units place:** \n     - For hundreds 100-399, each hundred has 10 pages with a 4 in the units place, totaling 3\u00d710=30.\n     - For 400-488, pages 404, 414, ..., 484 have a 4 in the units place, totaling 9.\n     - Total: 30 + 9 = 39\n   - Total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8 has an 8.\n   - Total 8's: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 have an 8 in the tens place, totaling 10.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 18, 28, ..., 98 have an 8 in the units place, totaling 9.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - For hundreds 100-399, each hundred has 10 pages with an 8 in the tens place, totaling 3\u00d710=30.\n     - For 400-488, pages 480-488 have an 8 in the tens place, totaling 9.\n     - Total: 30 + 9 = 39\n   - **Units place:** \n     - For hundreds 100-399, each hundred has 10 pages with an 8 in the units place, totaling 3\u00d710=30.\n     - For 400-488, pages 408, 418, ..., 488 have an 8 in the units place, totaling 9.\n     - Total: 30 + 9 = 39\n   - Total 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is page 4. So that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nIn the tens place: the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the ones place: for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-19 up to 90-99), that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the ones place.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. These are a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and ones. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 400-488 will have 4 in the hundreds place. Let me structure this properly.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, we're looking at pages 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to consider each hundred separately, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (like 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Since there are four hundred blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 isn't a full hundred. Let me check each block:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Each hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place, and there are four hundreds, so 4*10=40. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred block:\n\nIn each hundred, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every page. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages. Since each hundred has 100 pages, that's 10 occurrences in the ones place per hundred.\n\nSo, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the number of 4's in the ones place is:\n\n1. 100-199: 10 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 194).\n2. 200-299: 10 occurrences (204, 214, ..., 294).\n3. 300-399: 10 occurrences (304, 314, ..., 394).\n4. 400-488: Here, the last page is 488, so we need to check how many times 4 appears in the ones place. From 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a 4 in the ones place.\n\nWait, let me count: starting from 404, adding 10 each time: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences in the ones place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total 4's in the ones place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 10+10+10+9=39. Hmm, that seems correct because the last block doesn't have a full 10.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + ones (39) = 89+40=129, 129+39=168\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168. So total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. Then 20 + 168 (three-digit) = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: from 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. Again, count 8's in tens and ones places.\n\nIn the tens place: numbers 80-89. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the ones place: for each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 8 appears once in the ones place. So, 9 sets, so 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place except when the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nSo, let's go through each hundred block:\n\n1. 100-199: 180-189: 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, ones place in three-digit numbers: For each hundred block, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every page. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences per hundred.\n\nBut let's check each block:\n\n1. 100-199: 108,118,128,...,198: 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: Now, the ones digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 8's in the ones place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that last block. From 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the ones place? Starting at 408, each 10 pages: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included but 498 is not. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the ones place: 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: tens (39) + ones (39) = 78\nWait, no: hundreds place is 0, so total three-digit 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: tens place (40-49:10) + ones place (9) = 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's\n  - Tens place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488) = 40\n  - Ones place: 10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 39\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89+40+39=168\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: tens place (80-89:10) + ones place (9) = 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Tens place: 10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 39\n  - Ones place: 10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 39\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39+39=78\nTotal 8's: 1+19+78=98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider each separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers where the tens digit is 4 are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I count each digit. Let me count them one by one. From 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94.

Wait, no, actually, when I'm counting the units place, I should include all instances where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so in the tens place, we've already counted one 4, and in the units place, we count another 4. So, 44 contributes two 4's, which are both counted in their respective places. So, when I count the tens place, I get 10 (40-49), and when I count the units place, I get 9 (14,24,...,94). So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10 to 99, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49), each contributing one 4, so 10. The units digit is 4 for 9 numbers (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94), each contributing one 4, so 9. So, total 19 4's in two-digit numbers. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Here, each page number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I'll need to count the number of 4's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. How many 4's in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, 0.\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here. 0.\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's here. 0.\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers: 89.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break this down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149. Each of these contributes a 4 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit is 4 for 240-249, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n3. 300-399: The tens digit is 4 for 340-349, another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. However, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. Wait, but 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 100-199: 10 numbers (140-149). From 200-299: 10 numbers (240-249). From 300-399: 10 numbers (340-349). From 400-488: 10 numbers (440-449). So, 10 each, totaling 40. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, there's one number ending with 4. For example, 104,114,124,...,194. How many? From 100-199, the units digit is 4 for 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 204,214,224,...,294. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n3. 300-399: 304,314,324,...,394. Another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, we need to be careful here because 488 is the end. So, starting from 400, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, the numbers ending with 4 would be 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many? Let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because after 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, only 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129. 129 + 39 (units) = 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal 4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 1+19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check the three-digit numbers because 168 seems high.\n\nWait, hundreds place:89, tens:40, units:39. 89+40=129, 129+39=168. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's move on to counting the number of 8's. I'll need to do the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages: from 1 to 9. The only page number that has an 8 is page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers where the tens digit is 8 are from 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. Let's count them. From 10 to 99, the units digit is 8 for these 9 numbers:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. Each contributes one 8 in the units place, so 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 has an 8 in both tens and units place, so when counting the tens place, we've already counted the 8 in the tens digit. So, in the units place, we're counting the 8's that are not in the tens place. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit is 8 for 9 numbers, each contributing one 8, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: tens place (10) + units place (9) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10 to 99, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89), each contributing one 8, so 10. The units digit is 8 for 9 numbers (18,28,...,98), each contributing one 8, so 9. So, total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, and units digits.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. Since we're looking for 8's, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book because the highest page is 488. So, hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4, none of which are 8. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit from 100 to 488.\n\nBreaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit is 8 for 180-189. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. 200-299: The tens digit is 8 for 280-289, another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n3. 300-399: The tens digit is 8 for 380-389, another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n4. 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 8 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit is 8 for 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. 200-299: The units digit is 8 for 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. Another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n3. 300-399: The units digit is 8 for 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. Another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n4. 400-488: The units digit is 8 for 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count these. Starting from 408, each ten has one number ending with 8. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 498 would be beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, let me add that again:10+10+10+9=39. Yes.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nCounting the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count any digits. For example, in three-digit numbers, when I counted the hundreds place for 4's, I had 89, which is from 400-488. Then, in the tens and units places, I counted 40 and 39 respectively. That adds up to 168. Similarly, for 8's, in three-digit numbers, I had 39 in tens and 39 in units, totaling 78. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), how many 4's and 8's appear.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we get 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9), the only page with a 4 is page 4. So that's one occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit pages (10-99), I need to consider both the tens place and the ones place. Let's handle the tens place first. The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, and for each ten, there are 10 numbers. So, for the tens digit being 4 (i.e., 40-49), each of these 10 pages will have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 occurrences. \n\nNow, for the ones place in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, from 10 to 99, the ones digit cycles 1-9 ten times. So, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. Wait, no, actually from 10-99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, 9 times 1, which is 9. But wait, from 40-49, we've already counted the tens place, but the ones place in those numbers will also include a 4. So, for example, 44 has two 4's. So, in the ones place, from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear? It's 9 times, once in each ten's group, so 9 times. So, adding that to the tens place, which is 10 times, the total number of 4's in two-digit pages is 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 10-99, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). The ones digit 4 occurs in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times. So, yes, 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, that's pages 400-488. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit 4 occurs from 400 to 488. Let's figure out how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let's look at the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1-4. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers. \n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each for 10 pages. So, for each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. \n\nSo, for 100-199: tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 times. 300-399: 340-349, 10 times. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times. However, since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is fully included, so that's another 10. So, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does that affect the tens digit? No, because 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, it's 10 pages. So, total 40 times in the tens place for three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, the ones place for three-digit numbers. The ones digit cycles 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group, each tens group, the ones digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), and for each tens group (0-9), the ones digit 4 appears once. \n\nSo, for each hundreds group, there are 10 tens groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the ones place. So, per hundreds group, that's 10 occurrences. \n\nSo, for 100-199: 10 times. 200-299: 10 times. 300-399: 10 times. Now, 400-488: here, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits are 0-8, which is 9 tens groups. Each of these will have a ones digit 4 once. So, that's 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, that's 9 tens groups. In each of these, the ones digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. \n\nSo, total ones digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times. \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check. For 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, correct. So, yes, 39 times in the ones place. \n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + ones place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. \n\nTens place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then, 400-488 has 10 times (440-449), so 10. So total tens place is 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nOnes place: 100-199: 10 times. 200-299: 10. 300-399: 10. 400-488: 9. So total ones place: 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit 4's. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. So total 4's:1+19=20+168=188. \n\nWait, 1+19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. \n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): the only page with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99): again, consider tens and ones places. \n\nTens place: the tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89. That's 10 occurrences. \n\nOnes place: the ones digit is 8 in pages 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in two-digit pages:10+9=19. \n\nNow, three-digit pages (100-488). Again, hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. \n\nTens place: For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 pages each. So, for 100-199: 180-189 (10 pages). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39. \n\nOnes place: For each hundreds group and each tens group, the ones digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. \n\nSo, for 100-199: in each tens group (0-9), the ones digit 8 appears once. So, 10 times (108,118,...,198). Similarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298:10 times. 300-399:308,318,...,398:10 times. 400-488: in each tens group, the ones digit 8 appears once. The tens groups here are 0-8, so 9 tens groups. So, 9 times. \n\nSo, total ones place 8's:10+10+10+9=39. \n\nWait, but let me check 400-488. The ones digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, correct. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + ones place (39) =78. \n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20+78=98. \n\nSo, total 8's:98. \n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 =90. \n\nWait, that seems correct?

So, 19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 400-488:89. Tens place:100-199,200-299,300-399 each have 10, and 400-488 has 10, so 40. Ones place:100-199,200-299,300-399 each have 10, and 400-488 has 9, so 39. So, 89+40+39=168. Then 1+19=20+168=188. \n\nFor 8's: single-digit:1. Two-digit:80-89:10, ones place 18,28,...,98:9. So, 19. Three-digit: tens place:100-199,200-299,300-399 each have 10, 400-488 has 9:39. Ones place: same as tens, 39. So, 39+39=78. Total 8's:1+19+78=98. \n\nSo, 188-98=90. \n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place, the numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has a 4 in both tens and units place, but I'm only counting the units place here. So, from 14 to 94, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. How many are there? Let's see: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 4 appears once in each set of ten, so from 10-99, that's 9 sets (10-19, 20-29,...90-99), so 9 times in the units place. Wait, but 44 is in the 40-49 range, which we've already counted in the tens place. But when counting units digits, we still count 44's units digit as a 4, right? So, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, but since 44 is included, does that mean we have 9 occurrences? Wait, no, because 44 is in the 40-49 range, but the units digit 4 still occurs in 44. So, from 10 to 99, units digit 4 occurs 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, the digits are in the hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit from 100 to 488. Let's consider each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 0-8, since 488 is the last page. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, in total, the tens place 4's in three-digit numbers are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488. Let's go through each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: For each ten (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once per ten. There are 10 tens, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Now, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so after 484, the next would be 494, but that's beyond 488. So, how many are there? Let's count: starting at 400, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, because 404 is the first, and each subsequent 400 + 10n +4, where n goes from 0 to 8 (since 400 + 10*8 +4=484). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488: the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, but how many complete sets of 10 are there? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. 89 divided by 10 is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419,...,480-489), but since we stop at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each full decade (400-409, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 8 full decades (400-480), so 8 occurrences, plus in 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 9 occurrences in 400-488.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 would have 9 units digit 4's, which seems correct. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89+40=129+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me check that addition: 89 + 40 = 129, then 129 +39=168. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's total up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers: for each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in each, except maybe the last one. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times for each hundred, so 4 hundreds, so 40 times. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: for each hundred, 10 times, except the last one where it's 9 times, so 39 total. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1-9, the only 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10-99.\n\nTens place: numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: numbers where the units digit is 8: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10+9=19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: from 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the 800s, but our book goes up to 488, so there are no pages in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: in three-digit numbers, how many times does 8 appear in the tens digit?\n\nLet's go through each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 8 is in 180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488: The tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would have tens digit 8, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: how many times does 8 appear in the units digit?\n\nAgain, per hundred:\n\n- 100-199: in each ten, units digit 8 occurs once: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: similarly, 208,218,...,298:10\n- 300-399:308,318,...,398:10\n- 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 408 is the first, and each subsequent 10, up to 488. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488: the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 =78.\n\nWait, but wait: hundreds place is 0, tens place is 39, units place is 39, so total 78.\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10, units place 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9. So, 19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: in each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, except in 400-488, it's 10 times (440-449). So, 10*4=40. Correct.\n\nUnits place: in 100-199,200-299,300-399:10 each, so 30. In 400-488:9. So, total 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit. Plus single and two-digit:1+19=20, total 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89:10, units place 18,28,...,98:9. So,19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check if I missed anything.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book ends at 488, so no 800s. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: same, 39.\n\nSo, 78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but when I added up, I had 78 three-digit 8's, plus 19 two-digit, plus 1 single-digit, totaling 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check once more for any possible miscalculations.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:40-49:10\n\nUnits place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9\n\nTotal:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89\n\nTens place:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-449)=40\n\nWait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10.\n\nUnits place:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:80-89:10\n\nUnits place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9\n\nTotal:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:180-189 (10), 280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9):39\n\nUnits place:108,118,...,198 (10), 208,218,...,298 (10),308,318,...,398 (10),408,418,...,488 (9):39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: From 1 to 9, only the number 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider each separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: In the two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, ..., 94. Wait, but I need to be careful here. From 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's once every ten numbers, so from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so I might have counted both the tens and units place. Hmm, no, actually, when I'm counting the tens place, I counted all the 40-49, which includes 44, and now when I count the units place, I include 44 again. So, in the units place, from 14 to 94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, including 44. So that's 9 occurrences. So, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. Then, for the units place, in each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the 4 appears once in the units place, except for 40-49 where it's already counted in the tens place. So, from 10-39, that's three groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place: 14, 24, 34. Then, 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so 44 is included there. Then, from 50-99, that's five groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place: 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. So that's 3 + 5 = 8 occurrences in the units place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nWait, from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's list them: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. But in the tens place, from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, in two-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 + 9 = 19. But when considering units place, 44 is included in both counts, but that's okay because each digit is counted separately. So, 19 seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: From 100 to 488. Here, the digits can be in the hundreds, tens, or units place. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 488 is the last page, so 4 in the hundreds place goes up to 488, not 499.\n\nNow, for the digit 4 in the hundreds place: Pages from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. Let's think about each hundred group.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 140-149. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 4 appears in 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 4 appears in 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 appears in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is valid, but 450-488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is included. So, yes, that's 10 more.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 100-199, that's 10 occurrences (104,114,124,...,194).\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 400-488.\n\nStarting from 404, each 10 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 occurrences because 404 is the first, and 484 is the ninth. Wait, let me count: 404 is 1, 414 is 2, 424 is 3, 434 is 4, 444 is 5, 454 is 6, 464 is 7, 474 is 8, 484 is 9. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the units place for three-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 9 occurrences, not 10, because 484 is the last one. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTens place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (440-449). So that's 10*4=40.\n\nUnits place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, single-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, in the two-digit numbers, I had 19 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10-99.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10 numbers, each with a 4 in tens place:10.\n\nUnits place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, each with a 4 in units place, but 44 is already counted in the tens place, but each digit is counted separately, so it's okay to count both. So, 10+9=19. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: From 1-9, only 8 is present once. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 8 can appear in the tens place or units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10 numbers, each with an 8 in tens place:10.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in units place, including 88, which is already counted in the tens place. So, 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: From 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 100-488, so hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. But 8 in hundreds place would be 800-899, which is beyond 488, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit can be up to 8, so 480-488 is part of this. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399:308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in units place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, total 8's are:\n\nTens place:39\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal:78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place: no 8's.\n\nTens place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, so total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 4's:400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTens place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (440-449). So, 40.\n\nUnits place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39.\n\nTotal 4's:89+40+39=168.\n\nTwo-digit:19, single-digit:1. So, total 4's:168+19+1=188.\n\nFor 8's: three-digit tens place:39, units place:39, total 78.\n\nTwo-digit:19, single-digit:1. So, total 8's:78+19+1=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me think if I counted correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: In each group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, units place 4's:48*1 +1 (if 484 is within 481-488). Since 484 is in 481-488, so units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 19 in two-digit and 39 in three-digit, which added to 58. Hmm, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe this method is better. Let me try this.\n\nFor any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by considering higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of each digit place separately.\n\nLet's calculate the number of 4's in each digit place:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 48.\n\nBut we also need to check if the remaining numbers (488 - 48*10=8 numbers, i.e., 481-488) include a 4 in the units place. 484 is in this range, so that's an additional 1.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens place 4 appears 10 times. So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 449 is beyond 488? Wait, 449 is less than 488, so it's included. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, same as before.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, once. So, 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48.\n\nCheck the remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 488 is included, so that's an additional 1 (488).\n\nSo, units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. Each block has 10 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49)=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of it as 90, I was a bit surprised, but this method confirms it.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '4' in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's.\n     - The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n     - Total: 49 '4's.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - 4 complete hundreds contribute 4\u00d710=40 '4's.\n     - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10.\n     - Total: 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute 1 '8' in the units place.\n     - 48 complete groups give 48 '8's.\n     - The last partial group includes 488, adding 1.\n     - Total: 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In each hundred, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n     - 4 complete hundreds contribute 4\u00d710=40 '8's.\n     - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9.\n     - Total: 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0 '8's.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the units place. For single-digit page numbers, the only 4 is on page 4. So that's 1 occurrence. For two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 99, the digit 4 appears in the units place 9 times (4, 14, 24, ..., 84). Wait, actually, from 1 to 99, the units digit cycles 10 times, so for each ten's place, the units digit goes from 0 to 9. So for each ten's place (0,1,2,...,9), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. That's 10 times for two-digit numbers, but wait, from 1 to 99, it's actually 10 times in the units place (4,14,24,...,94). But wait, 94 is within 1-99, so that's 10 times. But actually, 04 is page 4, which is already counted in the single-digit numbers. So maybe I should adjust that. Wait, no, because when considering two-digit numbers, we start from 10, so the first units digit 4 in two-digit is 14. So from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). Wait, that's 9 times, not 10, because 04 is page 4, which is a single-digit number. So, in two-digit numbers, units place 4's: 9 times.\n\nThen, for three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred block. But since we're only going up to 488, let's see. From 100 to 199: units digit 4 appears 10 times (104,114,...,194). Similarly, 200-299: 10 times, 300-399: 10 times, and 400-488: how many times? From 400 to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, for three-digit numbers, units digit 4's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. From 100-199: 104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times. 300-399: 304,...,394: 10 times. Now, 400-488: The units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is within 400-488. So, total units digit 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, let's count the 4's in the tens place. For single-digit numbers, the tens place doesn't exist, so 0. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 100-488, so that's valid. So, each hundred block contributes 10 times in the tens place. So, from 100-199: 140-149: 10 times. 200-299:240-249:10 times. 300-399:340-349:10 times. 400-488:440-449:10 times. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, tens digit 4's: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50 times.\n\nNow, let's count the 4's in the hundreds place. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, hundreds digit 4's: 89 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's. Units place:39, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So total 4's: 39+50+89=178.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place:39, tens:50, hundreds:89. 39+50=89, 89+89=178. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check each part again.\n\nUnits place: From 1-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84). Then from 100-199:10 times, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9 times. So total units digit 4's:9+10+10+10+9=48? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nActually, for units digit 4, from 1-99: pages 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 10 times, not 9. Because 94 is included. So 10 times. Then from 100-199:104,114,...,194:10 times. 200-299:204,...,294:10 times. 300-399:304,...,394:10 times. 400-488:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484:9 times. So total units digit 4's:10+10+10+10+9=49? Wait, that can't be right because 1-99 is 10, and 100-488 is 300 numbers, which would have 30 times in units place, but 400-488 adds 9 more, so total 10+30+9=49? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula. For units digit, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1-488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 full blocks give 48 times, and in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So total units digit 4's:48 times. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier count. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing.\n\nWait, no, because in each block of 10, the units digit cycles 0-9, so digit 4 appears once per block. So from 1-480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times. Then 481-488: units digits 1-8, so no 4. So total units digit 4's:48 times. Hmm, that seems more accurate. So maybe I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 39. So perhaps I need to recast my approach.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 4: In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So from 1-99: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). From 100-199:140-149:10 times. 200-299:240-249:10 times. 300-399:340-349:10 times. 400-488:440-449:10 times, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. So total tens digit 4's:10 (1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488)=50 times.\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4: Only in 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units digit was 48, but earlier I thought it was 39. Hmm, I think the correct way is to use the formula: for units digit, in each 10 numbers, 1 occurrence, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full times, and the last partial block (481-488) doesn't add any, so 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit: in each 100 numbers, 10 times, so 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred (400-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? From 440-449:10 times, so total tens digit 4's:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds digit: only in 400-488:89 times.\n\nSo total 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units digit was 39, which was wrong. So 187 is the correct count for 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\nFirst, units digit 8's: In each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1-488, how many times? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 times. The last partial block (481-488) has 8 in the units place at 488, so that's 1 more. So total units digit 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens digit 8's: In each block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So from 1-99:80-89:10 times. 100-199:180-189:10 times. 200-299:280-289:10 times. 300-399:380-389:10 times. 400-488:480-488: how many times? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 block, tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So total tens digit 8's:10 (1-99)+10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=49 times.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: Only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit 8 never appears. So hundreds digit 8's:0 times.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98 times.\n\nWait, let me check units digit 8's again. From 1-488, each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so 48 full blocks give 48, and the last partial block (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's 1 more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens digit 8's: Each hundred block up to 400-488 contributes 10 times except the last one, which contributes 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting 4's. Let me recount.\n\nUnits digit 4's:48 times.\n\nTens digit 4's:50 times.\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nUnits digit 8's:49.\n\nTens digit 8's:49.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo difference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds digit 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct.\n\nTens digit 4's:10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds (1-399) plus 10 in 400-488 (440-449), so 5 hundreds? Wait, no, from 1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:10 (440-449). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits digit 4's:48, correct.\n\nSo 4's:187, 8's:98. Difference:89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought units digit 4's were 48, but when I first started, I thought it was 39. So I need to make sure I'm consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nBut I think the way I did it now is correct, using the block method. So the final answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) doesn't add any 4's in the units place.\n   - **Total units digit 4's:** 48\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1-99: 10 times.\n   - From 100-199: 10 times.\n   - From 200-299: 10 times.\n   - From 300-399: 10 times.\n   - From 400-488: 10 times (440-449).\n   - **Total tens digit 4's:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers.\n   - **Total hundreds digit 4's:** 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each block of 10 contributes 1 occurrence.\n   - From 1 to 488: 48 full blocks + 1 in the last partial block (488).\n   - **Total units digit 8's:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1-99: 10 times.\n   - From 100-199: 10 times.\n   - From 200-299: 10 times.\n   - From 300-399: 10 times.\n   - From 400-488: 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total tens digit 8's:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 400-488 have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total hundreds digit 8's:** 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"
