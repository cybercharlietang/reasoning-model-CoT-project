    "text": " That's 484/10 =48.4, but since we include both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. So 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers. So 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. So 49 eights. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49 eights. So total eights:49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount the number of terms. Let me try another approach for the units place of 4's and 8's. For units place, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor((n + 1)/10). So for 4's, n=488. So floor((488+1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48, but wait, that's not matching my earlier count. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. So for 4's, the first 4 is at 4, and the last at 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Similarly, for 8's, from 8 to 488, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated by considering how many full hundreds and the remaining part. For example, for 4's in the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 5 sets, 50 fours. For 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 49 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct. For the hundreds place, 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. 8's in the hundreds place don't appear because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4 and common difference 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place.\n\n   Total '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens Place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block except the last contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No pages fall into this category since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

For the 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears in page numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49** times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
