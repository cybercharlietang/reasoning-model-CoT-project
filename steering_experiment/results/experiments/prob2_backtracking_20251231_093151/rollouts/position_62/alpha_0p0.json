Wait, no, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.

Wait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position and sum them up again.
