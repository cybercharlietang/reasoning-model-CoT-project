So, units place:49. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. So, 49. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think differently. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total units place fours: 48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 440-449) =50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, for the 8's: Units place: same logic, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each with one 8, so 48, plus the last group has 488, which is an 8 in units place, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last hundred, which only goes up to 488. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: No eights, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.

Then, in the 49th group (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups give 48 fours, plus one more at 484, making 49. So, units place:49 fours. Tens place: For 4 in the tens place, it's every block of 100, starting at 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block has 10 fours. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then, 440-449 is the fifth block, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, for the 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Hundreds place: As before, none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought maybe 90 seems high, but after checking, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

From 1-488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,...,481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, it's 48 full decades and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times, plus in the 481-488 block, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49. That matches what I had before. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488.

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. The first is 4, then every 10. So, the number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 48 full steps, but including 4, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Hmm, that's the calculation, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula or considering each digit position separately. Wait, another way: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then sum them up. So, for units and tens, it's similar, but hundreds is a bit different because 488 is less than 500. Let me try that approach again. Units place: For each position, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated by higher digits and lower digits. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for units place, the number of times 4 appears is as we calculated: 49. Similarly for 8:49. Tens place: For 4, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 0-488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, actually, in the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 0-99:40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Similarly for 8 in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 49. Hundreds place: For 4, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8, it's 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0. So, same as before: fours total 188, eights total 98, difference 90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last block contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, the last set is 484, which is 48*10 +4. So, 48 times? Wait, no, because 4 is the first, 14 is the second, up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For the 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. That's 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. And for the 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book doesn't reach 800. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
