Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of '4's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st Digit):** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd Digit):** '4' appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd Digit):** '4' appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of '8's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st Digit):** '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd Digit):** '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd Digit):** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
