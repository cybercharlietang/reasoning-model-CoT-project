Difference:0. Correct. Another test: book with 50 pages. 4's: units:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925. Tens:40-49 \u219210. So, total 4's:15. 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925. Tens:40-49 has no 8's in tens place beyond 40-49, but wait, 80-89 is beyond 50, so only units place. So, 5 eights. So, difference:15-5=10.

Hundreds place: none. Total 1's:12. 2's: Units:2,12 (2). Tens:20-29, but since it's 20, only 20. So, tens:1. Units:2,12 (2). Hundreds: none. Total 2's:3. So, 12-3=9 more 1's than 2's. Let me list them: 1,2,11,12,10,11,12,...,19,20. Wait, maybe my counting was off, but the point is, the method seems to work in this smaller case. So, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
