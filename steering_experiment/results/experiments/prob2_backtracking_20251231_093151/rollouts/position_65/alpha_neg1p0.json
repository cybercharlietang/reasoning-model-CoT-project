Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's goes up to 488, which is 89 numbers, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, 488-400+1=89. Yes, correct. And for the tens place, the last set for 4's is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. All right, I think my counts are correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since 800-899 exceeds 488) \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
