Another way: for 4's, in units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in units, so 488//10=48 full groups, but since 488 is included, 488//10=48, but 48*10=480, so 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488.

For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, 8 in units. So, yes, it counts. Similarly, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is within the book, so that's fine. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 9 numbers, correct. So, yeah, 49 eights in tens place. So, 98 eights in total. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
