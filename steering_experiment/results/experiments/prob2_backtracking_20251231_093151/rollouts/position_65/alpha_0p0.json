Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, is it correct that from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers? Let me calculate: 488 -400 +1=89. Yes, that's correct. And in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each block contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488-480+1=9. Correct. So, that part is right. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think about whether I'm including all numbers correctly. For example, in the units place for 4's, 484 is included, which is correct. For the tens place, 440-449 is correct because 449 is less than 488. Similarly, for 8's, 480-488 is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think of page numbers, sometimes the hundreds place might have more, but in this case, since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, maybe 90 is correct. Let me think if there's another way to count. Alternatively, perhaps using a formula for each digit position. For units and tens places, the count is similar, but for hundreds, it's different. Let me try to calculate it again. For 4's: Units place: floor(488/10) =48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so units place 4's:48 +1=49. Tens place: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total tens place 4's:40 +10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod10=8, which is >=8, so units place 8's:48 +1=49. Tens place: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total tens place 8's:40 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

    "text": " Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: - Units: 8,18,...,488.
