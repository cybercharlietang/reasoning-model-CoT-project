    "text": " Wait, but wait, from 40-49 is the first 10, then 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449, which is 5 sets. So 5 x 10 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. Wait, 4 in the hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 4's = 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first 8 is at 8, and the last one is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, for the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of 4's in the tens place. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's, from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th occurrence because (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 units place.\n\nIn hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: units place is 49, as from 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does 488 include 488? Yes, because 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488: 400 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 in the tens place from the first four blocks, plus 9, total 49.\n\nSo, yes, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place 4's in 440-449 are all valid except for 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Yes, that seems correct. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To count how many, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book ends at 488, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems right. For fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Wait, but let me think about the units place for fours. From 4,14,...,484. How many numbers is that? The first is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for units place in eights, up to 488, which is 49 numbers. So, yes, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers from 800-899 exist in a 488-page book.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 5 sets would give 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the upper limit. The book ends at 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but we're only considering up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in the 480-489 range isn't fully included. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488. So, how many fours are in the tens place from 480-488? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so actually, the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, the last occurrence of 4 in the tens place is at 440-449, which is fully within 488. So, the count is indeed 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, which means 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). Setting that equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (e.g., 1-100) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) gives 10, and the last set (480-488) gives 9, so total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 450-488 is beyond that. So yes, 440-449 is included, so that's 10 numbers, making it 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488: Let me check. 8 is the first, then every 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8? Let me see: 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's break it down. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place count. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th term because (484 -4)/10 +1=48.4+1=49.4, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 49.\n\n- Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488:49 numbers.\n\n- Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits printed. From 1-9:9 numbers, 1 digit each:9 digits.\n\nFrom 10-99:90 numbers, 2 digits each:180 digits.\n\nFrom 100-488:389 numbers, 3 digits each:1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, let me think if there's another way to count the fours and eights. For example, in each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut I think my initial counts are correct.

    "text": " Wait, no, wait: from 0-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. We want the last term to be <=488. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 <=488. Subtract 4: (n-1)*10 <=484. Divide by 10: n-1 <=48.4, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Tens place: as before, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 +89= 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 <=488. So, 8 +10(n-1) <=488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1)<=480. Divide by 10: n-1<=48. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 eights, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Units place 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- **Total:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights in each place. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing 1 four. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. 4\u00d710=40, 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100:80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200:180-189 (10). 201-300:280-289 (10). 301-400:380-389 (10). 401-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, the first four blocks (1-400) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block (401-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 -98=90.

So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So units place: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-488, there are 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, but 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in each hundred, except maybe the last one, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Let's see: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, tens place is 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for all 89. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-480+1=9. So, the last set has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Now, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Total = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but does 440-449 count as a full set? Since 488 is beyond 449, yes, so 440-449 is a full set of 10. So, 5 sets of 10 give 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49,140-149, etc., 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is a page number. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 480, 481,...,488: each has 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place. But wait, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, but the hundreds digit is also 4. So, that's correct; each occurrence in the tens place is counted separately from the hundreds place. Similarly, in the units place, each occurrence is separate. So, that's correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers is that? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. For the tens place in 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 numbers. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full sets of 10, and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is 488, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: How many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400=88, but adding 1 gives 89. So, that's correct. For eights, the tens place in 480-488 is 9 numbers, which I included. So, yes, the total eights are 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 90.

So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89).

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 fours. So, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, we have to consider up to 488. So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

But wait, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, etc. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 in the units place occurs 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count the units place correctly? Let me check the units place for 4's. The first 4 is at 4, and every 10 numbers after that. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is floor((484 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. For 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, same way: floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct. For tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Correct. For tens place of 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, and the last is 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484 - 4}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 8}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, so \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.

So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89).

Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so I need to adjust for that. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last block has 9 numbers, so total is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but does 400 count? Yes, because 400 is included. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each block. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300: 280-289:10. 301-400: 380-389:10. 401-488: 480-488: 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's add them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct.

    "text": " Wait, but from 40-49 is the first 10, then each subsequent hundred adds another 10. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, but 440-449 is in the 401-500 range, but the book only goes up to 488. So, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth. So that's five sets, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 fours. Wait, but let me double-check the units place. I thought the units place had 49 fours, but let me recount. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the last incomplete decade. The total number of decades is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8), so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit is 4 at 484. So that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit is 8 at 488, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. Now, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book stops at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, each complete hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, but the last hundred (400-488) only contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 complete hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial hundred (400-488) contributing 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is in the first hundred, 180-189 in the second, 280-289 in the third, 380-389 in the fourth, and 480-488 in the fifth. So that's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets with 10 eights each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set with 9 eights (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but wait, when I count the tens place, I thought 480-488 contributes 9 eights, but let me make sure. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So yes, that's 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For the fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. That seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 fours total. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 within 488, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) adds one more 4 (at 484).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 fours.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 within 488, contributing 48 eights.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) adds one more 8 (at 488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last set (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0 eights.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units place: 49 fours, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 48 full tens, but let's check. The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We can set 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these sets contributes 10 eights except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so that's 9 eights (80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 49 occurrences because 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each with 10 eights, and the last block has 9 eights. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so 49 eights. So, I think my count is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480=8, so 9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, total 98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40+9=49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, the last one is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block before 400 contributes 10 eights, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers (480-488). Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me add that up: 10*4 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, but from 1-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 times, each giving 10 fours. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, step is 10. So ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units place is 49. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So 49 +50 +89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see. The first is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 =48 +1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4x10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89: total 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: total 98. So 188 -98=90.

So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, the 400-499 range is part of the 488 pages, so 440-449 is within that. So, actually, it's 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 terms.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again. From 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. Then each hundred block adds another 10. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is the 5th set. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so we don't have any more 4's in the tens place after that. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400 is the first, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last one, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block contributes 9 instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but let me check. From 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is in the 400s. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these has 10 numbers, so 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is correct. 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1=9). So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I thought earlier that maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but when I added up, I had 188. Let me double-check all counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I thought the answer was 90, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for 8's, I might have included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 pages. So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. But let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the answer was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the tens place for 4's again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th occurrence because (484 -4)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I've seen similar problems where the answer is 90, but sometimes people make off-by-one errors. Let me check the last number for units place 4: 484 is correct, as 484 +10=494, which is beyond 488, so 484 is the last one. So, 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place 8: 488 is the last, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 440-449:10 numbers, and 440+100=540, which is beyond 488, so that's correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 480-488:9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8\u00d749=482, but wait, 8\u00d750=400, which is beyond 488. Wait, no, actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 8s in the units place is the number of complete decades plus any extra. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th decade is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 more numbers, but the 8 in the units place in that decade is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99: 80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10 eights. 200-299:280-289:10 eights. 300-399:380-389:10 eights. 400-488:480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So that's 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, but let me check: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, it's 50. Because from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 =488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book ends at 488. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers are there? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The difference between terms is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. But wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here as well, from 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and then 9 more from 480-488. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) equals 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full block contributes 10, and 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, because each 100 numbers have one block where the tens digit is 4, so from 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours. Then from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 have a tens digit of 8? Yes, 480-489 is part of the book since it goes up to 488. So, how many blocks are there? Each block is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but the book stops at 488, so only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This is 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 50 + Hundreds: 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 49 + Hundreds: 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but from 40-49: 10, then 140-149: another 10, that's 20. Then 240-249: 30, 340-349:40, and 440-449:50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I'm counting each block as 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 8,18,...,488: let's see, starting from 8, each step is +10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)\u00d710. Let me find n when the term is \u2264488. 8 + (n-1)\u00d710 \u2264488 \u2192 (n-1)\u00d710 \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9. So, total is 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block (except the last) has 10 occurrences; the last has 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again. The first set is 40-49: 10 numbers, then 140-149: another 10, so that's 20 up to 199. Then 240-249: 30, 340-349:40, and 440-449:50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours. But wait, that seems high. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 50, which came from 10 each in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, but since we're only considering the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Units place: 49, because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 is the 49th. Wait, 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights, units place: 49, because 8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 terms. Correct. Tens place: 49, as calculated. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit is 8 there. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So total is 10*4 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So that's 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, that seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total.

This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '8' appears in blocks of 100 numbers, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, because from 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, each hundred block has a 40-49, so 10 per hundred. There are 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the 40-49 in that block would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 block of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
